ALPHA PEER: 8 THINGS TO LAUNCH
================================

1. MVP PLATFORM LIVE
--------------------
What this means: A working web application where creators can host courses, students can pay and schedule live sessions with student-teachers, and everyone can access course-specific chat feeds.

Key components:
- User accounts (creators, students, student-teachers)
- Course creation and hosting (video, materials, curriculum)
- Payment processing with 70/15/15 split (student-teacher / platform / creator)
- Scheduling system for 1-on-1 live sessions
- Video conferencing (integrate Zoom/Meet or built-in)
- Chat feeds exclusive to course completers
- Basic notifications (session reminders)

Success looks like: A student can sign up, pay for a course, book a session with a student-teacher, complete the session, and access the course chat feed.

Watch out for: Overbuilding. Launch with minimum viable features - polish comes later.


2. LIFETIME EARLY ADOPTER OFFER DEFINED
---------------------------------------
What this means: A compelling, time-limited incentive that rewards the first creators and students for taking a risk on an unproven platform.

Possible offers for creators:
- No monthly fee forever (waive the $25/month)
- Higher revenue share permanently (75% instead of 70%)
- "Founding Creator" badge and prominent placement
- First 100 creators only - creates urgency

Possible offers for students:
- Discounted first course
- Free access to one bonus course
- Priority scheduling with top student-teachers
- "Genesis Student" status with perks

Success looks like: An offer compelling enough that creators/students feel stupid saying no, but sustainable enough you won't regret it at scale.

Watch out for: Being too generous - these people get this forever. Make it valuable but bounded.


3. FINALIZE INTERFACE DETAILS
-----------------------------
What this means: Lock down the UI/UX decisions so the platform feels intuitive, professional, and consistent before launch.

Key areas to finalize:
- Navigation flow: How do users move between dashboard, courses, scheduling, chat?
- Course detail page: What info does a student see before enrolling? (description, price, student-teacher availability, reviews)
- Scheduling experience: Calendar view, time zone handling, confirmation flow
- Session interface: How do users join live sessions? Pre-session checklist?
- Chat feed layout: Threaded vs. flat? Notifications? Moderation tools?
- Mobile experience: Does it work well on phones/tablets?
- Creator dashboard: Course analytics, earnings, student-teacher management
- Student-teacher dashboard: Upcoming sessions, earnings, ratings

Design decisions:
- Color palette, typography, button styles (consistent throughout)
- Empty states (what do users see when they have no courses/sessions yet?)
- Error handling (clear messages when something goes wrong)
- Loading states (users know something is happening)

Success looks like: A new user can navigate the platform without asking "where do I click?" Everything feels cohesive and polished.

Watch out for: Endless tweaking. Set a deadline, make decisions, ship. You can refine post-launch based on real user feedback.


4. CREATOR ONBOARDING PROCESS DOCUMENTED
----------------------------------------
What this means: A clear, step-by-step guide that takes a new creator from "I'm interested" to "my course is live and students are enrolling."

What to include:
- Account setup and profile creation
- Course creation walkthrough (curriculum, pricing, materials)
- How the payment split works
- How to recruit and approve student-teachers
- Platform rules and quality expectations
- Support channels and resources
- Timeline: "Most creators launch within X days"

Formats:
- Written guide (PDF or web page)
- Video walkthrough (screen recording)
- Checklist they can print and follow
- Optional: live onboarding call for founding creators

Success looks like: A creator can go from signup to live course with minimal hand-holding. They feel confident, not confused.

Watch out for: Making it too long. People skim. Use visuals, keep steps short.


5. STUDENT-TEACHER TRAINING MATERIALS CREATED
---------------------------------------------
What this means: Resources that prepare students to become effective teachers, setting clear expectations and giving them practical skills.

Key content areas:
- The philosophy: "You're a peer guide, not a professor"
- Session structure: How to run a 30/60 minute session
- What to do when you don't know the answer (it's okay - use the chat feed)
- How to handle difficult students or situations
- Scheduling etiquette: show up on time, communicate cancellations
- How ratings and feedback work
- How you get paid

Formats:
- Short video series (5-10 min each)
- Quick reference guide (1-2 pages)
- FAQ document
- Optional: practice session with feedback

Success looks like: Student-teachers feel prepared, not thrown into the deep end. Session quality stays consistent.

Watch out for: Overtraining. These are peers, not employees. Keep it light and practical.


6. FIRST 50 PAYING STUDENTS ENROLLED
------------------------------------
What this means: Real humans paying real money to take courses on the platform. This is the moment of truth.

How to get them:
- Founders' personal networks (friends, colleagues, social media)
- Creator audiences (each founding creator promotes to their list)
- Targeted ads (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn for AI skills)
- Early adopter communities (Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, relevant Discords)
- Partnerships with bootcamps, companies doing upskilling

Key metrics to track:
- Cost per acquisition (how much marketing spend per student)
- Completion rate (what % finish the course)
- Student-to-teacher conversion (what % sign up to teach)
- Satisfaction/NPS scores

Success looks like: 50 students enrolled, 30+ complete, 6-10 sign up to become student-teachers. Flywheel starts.

Watch out for: Vanity signups. You want paying, engaged students - not free trials who ghost.


7. REFERRAL/AFFILIATE PROGRAM DESIGNED
--------------------------------------
What this means: A built-in system that rewards people for bringing new students and creators to the platform.

Possible structures:
- Student referral: "Give a friend $10 off, get $10 credit when they enroll"
- Student-teacher incentive: Bonus for each new student they recruit to their sessions
- Creator affiliate: Creators earn % of revenue from students they refer to other creators' courses
- External affiliates: Bloggers, influencers, newsletter writers get commission for referrals

Key decisions:
- Cash vs. platform credit?
- One-time bonus or recurring?
- Tracking mechanism (referral codes, links)
- Fraud prevention (no self-referrals, minimum purchase required)

Success looks like: 20-30% of new students come from referrals within 6 months. Acquisition cost drops.

Watch out for: Complexity. Start simple (one referral type), expand later.


8. SOCIAL PROOF COLLECTED
-------------------------
What this means: Real testimonials, case studies, and success stories that prove the platform works - essential for convincing skeptical new users.

What to collect:
- Student testimonials: "I learned X and now I can do Y"
- Student-teacher testimonials: "I earned $Z teaching what I just learned"
- Creator testimonials: "My course has X active student-teachers generating revenue"
- Metrics: completion rates, earnings data, satisfaction scores
- Before/after stories: "I knew nothing about AI, now I'm teaching it"

How to collect:
- Automated email after course completion asking for review
- Short video interviews with willing participants
- Screenshot earnings/achievements (with permission)
- Case study interviews with top performers

Where to use it:
- Landing page
- Course pages
- Marketing emails
- Social media
- Pitch decks for investors/partners

Success looks like: A library of 10-20 genuine testimonials you can rotate through marketing. Real faces, real names, real results.

Watch out for: Fake or incentivized reviews. Keep it authentic - one genuine story beats ten generic ones.
