## Work Progression

### Initial Analysis
- Reviewed existing mockup-dashboard.html
- Identified issues: big color headers, emoji icons, cluttered 4-tab layout (My Courses, Schedule, Students, Earnings)

### Design Iteration 1: Role-Based Toggle (v2)
- Proposed Learning/Teaching toggle instead of 4 feature tabs
- Created wireframe showing how information would be organized by user mindset
- Built mockup-dashboard-v2.html

### Design Iteration 2: Calendar + Session List (v3)
- Added mini calendar with colored dots (blue=learning, green=teaching)
- Click calendar day to scroll to sessions
- Created mockup-dashboard-v3.html
- Refined calendar to be more compact (~50% smaller)

### Design Iteration 3: Final Comprehensive Design (v4)
- Removed calendars entirely from main dashboard views
- Added prominent Weekly Availability card
- Changed stats from boxes to inline text
- Created sub-pages accessible via "View All" links
- Added interactive weekly grid for setting availability
- Created mockup-dashboard-v4.html

### P0 Requirements Analysis
- Reviewed full P0 MVP requirements list for Student-Teacher dashboard
- Mapped requirements to dashboard sections
- Designed information architecture: dashboard vs sub-pages

### Final Refinements
- Made Availability card more prominent (was buried in Action Needed)
- Changed boxed stats to text style
- Increased stat text size to match availability card

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Role-based toggle (Learning/Teaching) | Users think in mindset mode, not feature mode. Clearer mental model than 4 tabs |
| No "All" button | Confusing - users are usually in one mindset or the other |
| Remove calendars from main dashboard | Declutter. Calendar only needed for setting availability |
| Sub-pages via "View All" links | Keep sidebar clean. Natural discovery through dashboard sections |
| Text stats instead of boxed stats | Cleaner, less visual clutter, matches X.com aesthetic |
| Prominent Availability card | Important for S-T workflow, was buried before |
| Weekly grid for availability | Easy click-to-toggle interface for setting available hours |
| Students/Earnings/Availability as sub-pages | Logical hierarchy, teaching stuff lives under Dashboard |
