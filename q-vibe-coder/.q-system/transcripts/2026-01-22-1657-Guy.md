## Prior Work (from checkpoint 2026-01-22-1627)

- Explored codebase scheduling/booking flow (EnrollmentFlow, MainContent, MyCoursesView, StudentTeacherDashboard)
- Designed reschedule feature with text wireframes (5 wireframes: modal, confirmation, toast, My Courses view, teacher notification)
- Created RescheduleModal.js component with calendar + time slot picker
- Added `rescheduleSession()` function to MainContent.js with localStorage sync for both student and teacher
- Added `rescheduleModalSession` and `rescheduleToast` state to MainContent.js
- Wired Reschedule button into MyCoursesView (active course cards + calendar-selected session cards)
- Wired Reschedule button into CourseDetailView (sidebar "Next Session" section for purchased courses)
- Added `onRescheduleSession` prop to PurchasedCourseDetail
- Added reschedule notifications to StudentTeacherDashboard (reads from `rescheduleNotifications_{teacherId}` localStorage, shows banner with acknowledge button)
- Fixed early-return issue: RescheduleModal + toast now rendered inside the My Courses and purchased course detail return blocks (fragment wrappers)
- Verified build compiles successfully
- Tested in browser: Reschedule buttons appear correctly on My Courses page next to scheduled sessions

## Current Session Work (after checkpoint)

### ~16:30 - UI Testing & Feedback
- Opened app in browser via Playwright, logged in as Sarah Miller
- Navigated to My Courses page
- Found Reschedule button was too subtle (small underlined gray text after "with Alex Sanders")
- User feedback: "I see it that reschedule button needs to be next to the unfollow in the same format"

### ~16:35 - Move Reschedule Button to Pill Format
- Removed inline underlined Reschedule button from session info area in MyCoursesView.js
- Added Reschedule as a pill button in the action buttons area (same style as Schedule Now/Unfollow)
- Button shows when there IS a scheduled session (opposite of Schedule Now which shows when there ISN'T one)
- Verified in browser: "Reschedule | Unfollow" now appears for courses with sessions

### ~16:40 - Add "More Reschedule Options" Button
- User requested: "put under the reschedule session popup, under current session, Click here for more reschedule options button"
- Added button to RescheduleModal.js under the Current Booking section
- Initially styled as blue underlined link

### ~16:45 - Wire More Options to EnrollOptionsModal
- User clarified the button should open the 3-option enrollment modal (EnrollOptionsModal.js)
- The 3 options: Purchase Course Now/Schedule Later, Find a Student Teacher, Pick a Date First
- Added `onMoreOptions` prop to RescheduleModal
- In MainContent.js: passed `onMoreOptions` callback that closes reschedule modal and opens EnrollOptionsModal
- Bug found: EnrollOptionsModal wasn't rendering in My Courses flow (only in course detail view)
- Fix: Added EnrollOptionsModal render inside the My Courses fragment return block
- Tested and verified the full flow works

### ~16:50 - Style More Options as Pill Button
- User feedback: "make it a pill button just like the others. white background with black text"
- Changed from underlined blue link to white pill button (borderRadius: 20, background: '#fff', color: '#000', padding: '6px 16px')

## Summary

### All Accomplishments (Complete List)

- Built rescheduleSession() function with localStorage sync
- Wired Reschedule into MyCoursesView, CourseDetailView, PurchasedCourseDetail
- Added teacher reschedule notifications to StudentTeacherDashboard
- Fixed early-return rendering issues with fragment wrappers
- Moved Reschedule button from inline link to pill format (matching Unfollow style)
- Added "Click here for more reschedule options" pill button to RescheduleModal
- Connected more options button to EnrollOptionsModal (3-option scheduling flow)

### Files Changed
- Created: `my-project/code/src/components/RescheduleModal.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/MyCoursesView.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/CourseDetailView.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/PurchasedCourseDetail.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/StudentTeacherDashboard.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/App.js`
- Modified: `my-project/code/src/components/Login.js`

### Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Pill button format for Reschedule | Matches existing Unfollow/Schedule Now styling |
| Reschedule shows when session exists, Schedule Now when not | Mutually exclusive states |
| More options opens EnrollOptionsModal | Reuses existing 3-option flow for consistency |
| White pill with black text for more options | Distinct from modal background while matching pill style |
| Fragment wrapper for EnrollOptionsModal in My Courses | Early-return blocks need their own modal renders |
