### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Option B chosen | User prefers full-width banner headers for stronger visual hierarchy |
| Circle badges for communities | Universal UX pattern - circles = people/social |
| Square badges for courses | Maintains structured content association |
| Keep all data, reduce spacing only | User wanted condensed view without removing information |
| Green Enroll buttons | Matches course badge color for visual consistency |
| Update ALL files for consistency | Unified design across DiscoverView, Sidebar, MyCoursesView, BrowseView, FeedsSlideoutPanel |
