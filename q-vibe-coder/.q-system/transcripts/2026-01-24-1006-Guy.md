### Key Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| borderRadius: 0 everywhere | User wanted square UI elements |
| Remove all card borders/margins | Cleaner edge-to-edge design |
| Pills above header card | User preference from iteration |
| Scroll arrows on pills | User requested explicit navigation |
| Right sidebar 280px | Matching Figma design reference |
| Sidebar hidden < 1100px | Only show when enough screen space |
| flex: 0 0 auto on center | Prevent center shrinking when sidebar present |
| Banner width: '100%' clean | calc hack was unreliable |

### Open Issues
- "Where did all the feeds go for communities" - user reported but uninvestigated
- Sidebar JSX nesting may need final verification on user's browser
