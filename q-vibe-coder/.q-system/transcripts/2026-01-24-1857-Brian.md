| Sessions & Progress contains all progress info | Consolidate tracking in one tab |
| 4 tabs for enrolled: Overview, Sessions & Progress, Course Feed, Reviews | Cleaner navigation |
| 3 tabs for non-enrolled: Overview, Course Feed, Reviews | Simpler for prospects |
| Sidebar only shows What You'll Learn | Clean, consistent layout |
