### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Community selector on top with count + arrow | User requested this layout - shows active community prominently |
| "My Feeds" as static label below | Simplifies the UI - no arrow needed |
| Arrow points outward not dropdown | User specified outward-pointing arrow for side panel |
| Remove grey vertical line | User requested removal of decorative line |
| Match Discovery course format to Discovery page | User wanted consistency across views |
| The Commons stays fixed in slideout | User requested Commons always visible while communities scroll |
| Button "1" to "Ask AI" | User requested this specific label |
| Hardcode post count to 189 | Random number was causing display issues on scroll |
| Match Discovery pills to My Feeds style | User wanted consistent styling across views |
| Use pure white (#ffffff) for pills | User said #f7f9f9 looked too grey |
| Check for `demo_new` explicitly | Most reliable way to identify New User account |
| Exclude The Commons from community count | Shows user's joined communities only |
