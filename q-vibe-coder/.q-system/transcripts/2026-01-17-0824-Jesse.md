## Prior Work (from checkpoints/summary)

### From checkpoint 2026-01-17-0755:

1. **Fixed Scrolling Bug in Course Detail View**
   - User reported scrolling stopped working inside courses
   - Investigated using Playwright browser automation
   - Root cause: `.main-content` had `overflow: hidden` blocking all vertical scrolling
   - Course content was 1738px but only 765px visible
   - Fix: Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden`
   - Committed: 2bc7201

2. **Changed Menu Text**
   - Changed left menu slideout trigger text from "11 communities" to "Choose A Community Feed"
   - Updated `Sidebar.js` line 449
   - Committed: e2b4364

3. **Deployed Both Changes**
   - Pushed to GitHub
   - Deployed to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`
   - Live at: https://peerloopllc.github.io/Peerloop-v2/

## Current Session Work

### 08:10 - Community Pills Investigation

User noticed when opening the app for the first time, community pills were displayed across the top simultaneously with the slideout menu. They wanted to:
1. Disable pills by default (use slideout only)
2. Hide "Choose A Community Feed" when no communities are available

### 08:15 - Code Analysis

Found the relevant code:
- `Community.js` line 47-49: `communityNavStyle` state controls display mode
- Default was `'pills'`, needed to change to `'slideout'`
- `Sidebar.js` line 449: "Choose A Community Feed" text displayed unconditionally

### 08:20 - Implemented Changes

1. **Changed default nav style** (`Community.js` line 49):
   - Before: `return saved || 'pills';`
   - After: `return saved || 'slideout';`

2. **Made "Choose A Community Feed" conditional** (`Sidebar.js` line 449):
   - Before: `<span className="community-selector-count">Choose A Community Feed</span>`
   - After: `{hasFollowedCommunities && <span className="community-selector-count">Choose A Community Feed</span>}`

### 08:24 - Opened app in external browser for testing

## Summary

### All Accomplishments (Complete List)
1. Fixed scrolling bug in course detail view (overflow: hidden → overflow-y: auto)
2. Changed menu text from community count to "Choose A Community Feed"
3. Deployed scroll fix and menu text changes to GitHub Pages
4. Changed default community navigation style from 'pills' to 'slideout'
5. Made "Choose A Community Feed" text conditional on having communities

### Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.css` - Line 5: scroll fix
- `my-project/code/src/components/Sidebar.js` - Line 449: menu text, then conditional display
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` - Line 49: default nav style change

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use `overflow-y: auto` instead of `overflow: auto` | Allows vertical scroll while preventing unwanted horizontal scroll |
| Default to 'slideout' instead of 'pills' | User wanted slideout as default, pills optional via profile settings |
| Conditional "Choose A Community Feed" | No point showing instruction to choose communities if there are none |
