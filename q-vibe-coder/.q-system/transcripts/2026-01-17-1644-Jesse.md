### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Pill-shaped buttons (borderRadius: 20) | Match Discover menu button styling |
| Sticky header with frosted glass | Match Community.js My Feeds header behavior |
| localStorage for filter/scroll persistence | Maintain state across navigation without lifting state |
| Collapsible header pattern with refs | Avoid stale closure issues in scroll handlers |
| BBB popup alternative documented | iPad Safari has issues with iframes |
