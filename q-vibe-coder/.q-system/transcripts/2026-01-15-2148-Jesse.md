## Prior Work (from checkpoints/summary)

### From checkpoint 2042-Jesse:
- Updated My Feeds community header cards to use colored gradient backgrounds matching Discovery page
- Implemented alternating pastel color backgrounds for creator profile cards (4 colors cycling)
- Updated pills mode profile card styling (lines 1769-1789 in Community.js)
- Updated selector mode profile card styling (lines 1124-1148 in Community.js)
- Verified changes compile without errors
- Tested in browser - colors cycle correctly between creators

### From checkpoint 2130-Jesse:
- Connected Profile banner color selection to My Feeds and Discovery page headers
- Added `bannerColor` state to Community.js and DiscoverView.js that reads from localStorage
- Updated selector mode and pills mode profile cards in Community.js to use user's selected banner color
- Updated DiscoverView.js search results to use user's selected banner color
- Redesigned The Commons header with hero banner image layout
- Copied user's exact screenshot image to `public/commons-banner.png`
- Cropped the banner image to remove text portion (878x318 → 878x174)
- Changed Alex Sanders' avatar from `img=68` to `img=12` to differentiate from Albert Einstein

## Current Session Work

### 21:30 - Avatar Verification
- User requested visual verification that Alex Sanders' avatar is different from Albert Einstein's
- Logged into app as Alex Sanders and navigated to Albert Einstein Community
- Took screenshots comparing the two avatars
- User noticed they still looked similar

### 21:35 - Avatar Fix Discovery
- Used Grep to find all occurrences of Alex Sanders' avatar (img=68)
- Discovered additional files still using the old avatar:
  - `Login.js:26` - Alex Sanders demo user definition
  - `getstream.js:201` and `getstream.js:233` - Activity feed mock data
- Albert Einstein also uses img=68 in database.js and communityPosts.js

### 21:40 - Avatar Updates (Round 1)
- Updated Login.js: Changed Alex's avatar from img=68 to img=12
- Updated getstream.js: Changed both Alex references from img=68 to img=12
- Refreshed browser and re-logged in
- User still said they looked similar (img=12 apparently similar to img=68)

### 21:45 - Avatar Updates (Round 2)
- Changed strategy: Use completely different avatar number
- Updated all files to use img=3 instead:
  - App.js: Changed from img=12 to img=3
  - Login.js: Changed from img=12 to img=3
  - getstream.js (both occurrences): Changed from img=12 to img=3
- Refreshed browser and verified
- img=3 shows bearded man with shorter dark hair - clearly different from Einstein's wild gray hair

## Summary

### All Accomplishments (Complete List)
1. Implemented colored gradient backgrounds for My Feeds community header cards
2. Added 4 alternating pastel colors matching Discovery page style
3. Connected Profile banner color selection to My Feeds headers
4. Connected Profile banner color selection to Discovery page headers
5. Added `getUserBannerGradient()` helper function to both components
6. Redesigned The Commons header with hero banner image layout
7. Created and cropped `commons-banner.png` for The Commons header
8. Changed Alex Sanders avatar to be different from Albert Einstein
9. Fixed Alex avatar in Login.js (demo users)
10. Fixed Alex avatar in getstream.js (activity feed mock data)
11. Final avatar: img=3 (bearded man) vs Einstein's img=68 (wild gray hair)

### Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-project/code/public/commons-banner.png` - Cropped hero image for The Commons

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` - Banner color logic, colored gradients, The Commons hero redesign
- `my-project/code/src/components/DiscoverView.js` - Banner color logic for search results
- `my-project/code/src/App.js` - Alex Sanders avatar URL (img=3)
- `my-project/code/src/components/Login.js` - Alex Sanders demo user avatar (img=3)
- `my-project/code/src/services/getstream.js` - Alex Sanders activity feed avatars (img=3)

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Read banner color from localStorage in each component | Allows consistent color across Profile, My Feeds, and Discovery without prop drilling |
| Use `getUserBannerGradient()` helper function | Centralized gradient generation for cleaner code |
| Crop screenshot image to 55% height | Remove text portion from original screenshot since text is rendered separately |
| Use img=3 for Alex Sanders | img=12 looked too similar to Einstein; img=3 (bearded man) is clearly distinct |
| Update all files with Alex's avatar | Consistency across demo login, activity feeds, and main app |
