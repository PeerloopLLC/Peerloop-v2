### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Store sessions in localStorage per user | Persists across refreshes, consistent with purchasedCourses |
| Use date string format 'YYYY-MM-DD' | Easy to compare and use as object keys |
| Show dots (not numbers) on calendar | Cleaner visual |
| Session status field | Allows cancelled/completed without deleting data |
| Full format for date-selected courses | Consistency with All Courses list |
| Sync purchasedCourses to followedCourseIds | Ensures course pills appear in communities |
