## Current Session Work

### ~18:30 - Scrollbar Removal
User requested removal of scrollbars across all views to match "My Feeds" styling.

**Changes made:**
- Added global scrollbar hiding to `index.css` (applies to all elements)
- Added scrollbar hiding to `.main-content` and `.center-column` in `MainContent.css`
- Added scrollbar hiding to `.feed-list` in `ActivityFeed.css`

**CSS applied:**
```css
scrollbar-width: none;        /* Firefox */
-ms-overflow-style: none;     /* IE/Edge */
::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }  /* Chrome, Safari, Edge */
```

### ~18:45 - Course Icon Color Change
User requested course icons be changed from green to match community header color (cyan).

**Initial changes:**
- Updated `iconConfig.course.gradient` in database.js to cyan
- Updated 4 individual `thumbnailGradient` values in database.js to cyan
- Updated `getCourseGradient()` function in DiscoverView.js to cyan

**Problem:** Course icons still showed green after refresh.

**Root cause found:** Hardcoded green gradient at DiscoverView.js line 1453:
```javascript
background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #22c55e, #16a34a)'
```

**Fix:** Changed to use `getCourseGradient()` function instead of hardcoded value.

**Final result:** All course icons now display cyan gradient matching community header.

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Move tabs above Your Sessions | Better visual hierarchy - tabs control content below |
| Remove Session Files tab | Files integrated into Curriculum per module |
| Grey session circles | Less visual noise, green reserved for completed |
| Green Join button | Matches Enroll button, indicates action |
| Name comparison for isCreator | User ID format differs from instructorId |
| Global scrollbar hiding | Cleaner look matching My Feeds, still scrollable |
| Cyan course icons | Matches community header color for visual consistency |
