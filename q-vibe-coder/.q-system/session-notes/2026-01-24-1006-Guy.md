# Session Notes: 2026-01-24-1006-Guy

**Summary:** Restyled Community selector from pill to square shape with full-width edges, redesigned Discover page with square search bar, scrollable pills with arrows, bold title, and added a right sidebar showing 2 suggested courses matching the Figma design. Fixed Commons banner width by removing calc hack.

## Key Accomplishments

- Community selector: pill -> square, full-width, no borders/margins/shadows
- Community banner: clean width: '100%' (removed calc hack)
- Discover search bar: square shape, full-width matching header card
- Discover header: added bold "Discover Communities and Courses" title
- Discover pills: moved above card, added left/right scroll arrows
- Discover sidebar: "Suggested Courses" with 2 unenrolled courses, responsive

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Square UI elements (borderRadius: 0) | User preference for clean edges |
| Pills above gradient card | User iteration on layout |
| Scroll arrows on pills | Explicit navigation affordance |
| Right sidebar with 2 courses | Matching Figma design reference |
| Sidebar hidden < 1100px | Responsive - only when room available |
| Center column flex: 0 0 auto | Prevent layout shrinking with sidebar |
