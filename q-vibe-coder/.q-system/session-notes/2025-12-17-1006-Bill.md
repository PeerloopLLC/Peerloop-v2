# Session Notes: 2025-12-17-1006-Bill

**Summary:** Redesigned the Student-Teacher Dashboard through 3 design iterations. Final mockup (v4) uses a Learning/Teaching toggle, text-style stats, prominent availability card, and sub-pages for Students/Earnings/Availability. Design addresses P0 MVP requirements for scheduling, student management, sessions, and earnings.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Learning/Teaching toggle | Users think in mindset mode, clearer than 4 feature tabs |
| No calendar on main dashboard | Declutter; only needed for setting availability |
| Sub-pages via View All links | Keep sidebar clean, natural discovery |
| Text stats (not boxes) | Cleaner aesthetic, matches X.com style |
| Prominent Availability card | Critical for S-T workflow |
