- Main Hall added as explicit audience option in dropdown
- Post button wired to createPost service (Supabase), real-time feed updates

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Square UI elements | User aesthetic preference |
| X.com sidebar layout | User reference for More popup + Post button |
| Nested audience tree | User approved Option A |
| Custom event for post sync | Cross-component communication without shared state |
| Main Hall explicit option | Title-click was non-obvious for users |
| Save enrollment state to nav history | Fixes back button from profile to scheduling |
| Hidden scrollbar | User chose X.com style |
