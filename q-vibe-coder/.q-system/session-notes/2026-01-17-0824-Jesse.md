# Session Notes: 2026-01-17-0824-Jesse

**Summary:** Fixed scrolling bug in course detail view, changed menu text, deployed to GitHub Pages, then changed default community navigation from pills to slideout and made the "Choose A Community Feed" text conditional on having communities.

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Fixed scrolling bug in course detail view (changed overflow from hidden to auto)
- Changed left menu text from community count to "Choose A Community Feed"
- Deployed both changes to GitHub Pages (live site updated)
- Changed default community navigation style from 'pills' to 'slideout'
- Made "Choose A Community Feed" text only show when communities exist

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden` | Enables vertical scrolling while preventing horizontal overflow |
| Default to 'slideout' nav style | User preference - pills can still be enabled in profile settings |
| Hide "Choose A Community Feed" when no communities | Cleaner UX - no point showing instruction when there's nothing to choose |
