## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use same tab style as course detail page | User requested clean horizontal button style matching "Overview, Course Feed, etc." |
| Three content types: video, file, link | Covers common free content creators share (tips, resources, external links) |
| Check `isSlideoutPanelOpen` before toggling | Prevents event race condition where panel closes then immediately opens |
| Close panel on My Feeds click | Better UX - panel should close when clicking related nav item |
