# Session Notes: 2026-01-22-1457-Guy

**Summary:** Extended session fixing multiple enrollment, booking, and teacher workspace sync issues in PeerLoop. Key fixes include cross-user localStorage sync for teacher/student sessions, certification flow fix, Find a Teacher list and navigation improvements, and calendar date updates to Jan-Mar 2026.

## Key Accomplishments

- Updated enrollment calendar to January 2026 with available dates through March 2026
- Fixed student teacher profile navigation to use common Profile component
- Removed teacher list limit (was showing only 8, now shows all 16)
- Fixed cross-user data sync: My Courses bookings now update teacher's workspace
- Fixed certification flow: properly marks sessions as completed (fixed enrollmentId parsing)
- Changed Find a Teacher card click to go directly to booking
- Suppressed benign ResizeObserver error overlay
- Added teacher login sync: scans all students' localStorage for assigned sessions
- Added teacher stats sync: activeStudents populated from all scheduledSessions on login

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove `.slice(0, 8)` teacher limit | All student teachers should be visible |
| localStorage scan on teacher login | Cross-user sync without a real backend |
| Parse enrollmentId format for certification | Format `userId-courseId` wasn't matching raw studentId |
| Card click → booking (not profile) | User's expected UX behavior |
| Suppress ResizeObserver error | Benign webpack-dev-server overlay issue |
| Calendar starts Jan 2026 | User requested current dates |
