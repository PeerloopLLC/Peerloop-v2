## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Sessions in localStorage per user | Consistent with purchasedCourses pattern |
| Date format 'YYYY-MM-DD' | Easy comparison and object keys |
| Dots instead of numbers on calendar | Cleaner visual |
| Session status field | Support cancelled/completed without deletion |
| Sync purchased to followedCourseIds | Ensures course pills appear |
