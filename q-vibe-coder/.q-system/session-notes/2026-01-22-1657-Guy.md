# Session Notes: 2026-01-22-1657-Guy

**Summary:** Built the full reschedule feature for PeerLoop - RescheduleModal with calendar/time picker, wired into My Courses and Course Detail views, added teacher notifications, then refined the UX based on live testing (pill button styling, "more options" flow connecting to EnrollOptionsModal).

---

## Key Accomplishments

- Created RescheduleModal.js with calendar, time slot picker, and 2-step confirmation flow
- Added rescheduleSession() function to MainContent.js with localStorage sync
- Wired Reschedule button into MyCoursesView, CourseDetailView, and PurchasedCourseDetail
- Added reschedule notifications to StudentTeacherDashboard
- Moved Reschedule button from subtle inline link to visible pill button (matching Unfollow style)
- Added "Click here for more reschedule options" white pill button in RescheduleModal
- Connected more options to existing EnrollOptionsModal (Purchase/Find Teacher/Pick Date)
- Fixed rendering issues (fragment wrappers for early-return blocks, EnrollOptionsModal in My Courses flow)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Reuse generateAvailability logic | Consistency with existing booking flow |
| Modal approach (not inline) | Compact, focused UX |
| Two-step modal (select then confirm) | Prevents accidental reschedules |
| localStorage for notifications | Cross-user sync pattern already in app |
| Pill button for Reschedule | Matches existing UI elements (Unfollow, Schedule Now) |
| White pill for more options | Visible but distinct from modal background |
| Connect to EnrollOptionsModal | Reuses existing 3-option flow |

- [ ] Consider updating calendar-selected session cards button (second location in MyCoursesView)
