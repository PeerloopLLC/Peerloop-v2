# Session Notes: 2026-01-16-0705-Jesse

**Summary:** Major UI session focusing on sidebar redesign, styling consistency across the app, and New User experience. Swapped sidebar menu positions, made Discovery pills match My Feeds styling, fixed The Commons slideout panel, and ensured New User starts with a clean slate (no communities, no courses).

---

## Key Accomplishments

**Sidebar:**
- Swapped menu positions: community selector on top, "My Feeds" label below
- Community selector shows name + count + outward arrow
- Removed grey vertical line from sidebar
- Fixed community count to exclude The Commons
- Added singular/plural handling for community count

**Styling Consistency:**
- Connected banner color to View All Courses header
- Course cards in BrowseView now match Discovery page format
- Discovery pills now match My Feeds style (white background, border, blue selected)

**Slideout Panel:**
- The Commons section fixed at top
- My Communities scrolls independently below

**Content:**
- Changed Commons button "1" to "Ask AI"
- Fixed random post count (hardcoded to 189)

**New User Experience:**
- New User (demo_new) starts with no joined communities
- New User starts with no enrolled courses
- Sidebar shows "0 communities" for New User

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Community selector on top | User wanted active community shown prominently |
| Hardcode post count to 189 | Random number caused display issues on scroll |
| Pure white (#ffffff) for pills | User said #f7f9f9 looked too grey |
| Check demo_new explicitly | Most reliable way to identify New User |
| The Commons fixed in slideout | User wants Commons always visible |
