## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Click-to-open popup (not auto) | User prefers explicit action to play |
| Vimeo embed | Cleaner than YouTube, no ads |
| vumbnail.com for thumbnail | Free Vimeo thumbnail service |
| Autoplay in popup | Good UX when user clicks to watch |
| Remove pills 2-3 | Wireframe cleanup |
