# Session Notes: 2026-01-24-1857-Brian

**Summary:** Redesigned the Course Detail page to have a unified layout for both enrolled and non-enrolled users. The Overview tab now shows video, What You'll Learn sidebar, Topics, and Course Curriculum for both states. All progress tracking (sessions, homework, certificates) was consolidated into the Sessions & Progress tab for enrolled users.
