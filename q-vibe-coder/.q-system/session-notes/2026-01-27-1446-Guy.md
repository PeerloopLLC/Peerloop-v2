- Unified badge color scheme: Blue communities + Green courses

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 👥 emoji for community badges | Universal "group" symbol, immediately recognizable |
| Letter abbreviations for courses | Distinct from community badges, easy course identification |
| Blue communities + Green courses | Selected from 8 mockup options for clear visual distinction |
| Pill tabs for course detail | Consistent with My Feeds style |
| Sessions for all courses | Enables session timeline and Join button for all enrolled users |
