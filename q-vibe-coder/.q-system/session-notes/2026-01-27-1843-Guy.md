# Session Notes: 2026-01-27-1843-Guy

**Summary:** Implemented Option B wireframe design for the Discover Tab UX. Communities now display as full-width gradient banner headers with circle avatars, while courses are nested below in gray containers with square badges. This establishes a clear visual design system: circles = communities/social, squares = courses/content.
