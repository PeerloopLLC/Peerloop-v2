## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Sticky header with frosted glass | Match Community.js My Feeds header behavior |
| Pill-shaped buttons | Consistent styling across app |
| localStorage for persistence | Maintain state without lifting to parent components |
| Collapsible pattern with refs | Avoid stale closure issues in scroll handlers |
| Document BBB popup approach | iPad Safari has iframe limitations |
