# Session Notes: 2026-01-23-1039-Guy

**Summary:** Major redesign of the community selector card UI. Implemented Reddit-style pill selector, unified layout across communities (pill in white space, colored header below), added full-height dropdown with descriptions, scroll-collapse behavior, and enhanced visual contrast. Also cleaned up sidebar navigation for selector mode.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Reddit-style pill | Universally recognized as interactive element |
| White space around pill, text in gradient | User preference for clear separation |
| Two chevrons | User wanted both positions |
| calc(100vh - 75px) dropdown height | Fill available space for many listings |
| Hide sidebar menu in selector mode | Avoids redundancy |
| 2px border + box shadow on pill | Greater contrast per user request |
| Reuse isProfileCollapsed state | DRY - scroll handler already exists |
| "{name} Community" labels | Explicit community identification |
