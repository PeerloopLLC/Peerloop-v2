# Session Notes: 2026-01-18-2200-Brian

**Summary:** Fixed critical bug where welcome sticky card persisted in Discover view after completing signup in The Commons. Lifted signupCompleted state to MainContent.js for sharing between views. Also improved Discover scroll behavior to start at top on first visit.

## Key Accomplishments

- Fixed welcome card bug: now disappears in both Commons AND Discover after signup
- Lifted signupCompleted state from components to shared parent (MainContent.js)
- Improved Discover scroll: starts at top on first visit, remembers position on return
- Changed scroll storage from localStorage to sessionStorage
- Tested full signup flow: interests → communities → app

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Lift state to MainContent | Both Community and DiscoverView need shared signup state |
| Use sessionStorage for scroll | Auto-clears on new browser session, better UX |
| Save scroll during scroll events | More reliable than cleanup function (ref may be null) |
