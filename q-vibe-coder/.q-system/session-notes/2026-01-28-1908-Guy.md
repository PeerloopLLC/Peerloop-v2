# Session Notes: 2026-01-28-1908-Guy

**Summary:** Redesigned course detail page with pill tabs above sessions, integrated files into curriculum with creator-only "+ Add File" button, and updated styling (grey session circles, green Join button, hidden scrollbars). Changed course icons from green to cyan to match community header color.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Move tabs above Your Sessions | Better visual hierarchy - tabs control content below |
| Remove Session Files tab | Files integrated into Curriculum per module |
| Grey session circles | Less visual noise, green reserved for completed |
| Green Join button | Matches Enroll button, indicates action |
| Name comparison for isCreator | User ID format differs from instructorId |
| Global scrollbar hiding | Cleaner look matching My Feeds |
| Cyan course icons | Visual consistency with community header |
