## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Connector lines for community-course hierarchy | Clear visual parent-child relationship |
| Supabase Storage for session files | Public URLs available immediately, no app deployment needed |
| XML POST to BBB API | Required format for pre-uploading presentations |
| sessionFiles in course database | Clean association between files and courses |
