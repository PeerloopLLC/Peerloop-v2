# Session Notes: 2026-01-22-1122-Guy

**Summary:** Major session adding Member Search feature, improving Find Teacher view with clickable cards and search, implementing side-by-side calendar booking layout, integrating real user profiles, and fixing back navigation from teacher profile view.

## Key Accomplishments

- Added Member Search feature to The Commons (replaced "Ask AI" pill)
- Created MemberSearchView component with 31 searchable members
- Modified Profile.js to display any user's profile (not just logged-in user)
- Made teacher summary cards clickable to navigate to profile
- Added search bar to FindTeacherView (filters name, bio, specialties, location)
- Implemented side-by-side calendar layout for booking (calendar left, times right)
- Integrated real user profiles from users.js into teacher lists
- Fixed back navigation: teacher profile -> back now returns to Find Teacher (not Discover)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Member Search in The Commons | Natural community hub location, replaces unused "Ask AI" |
| Click entire teacher card for profile | More intuitive than small link |
| Remove sessions/reviews from summary cards | Cleaner design, user requested |
| Don't call onMenuChange when restoring Find Teacher state | Prevents useEffect from clearing viewingCourseFromCommunity |
| Use colored initials for avatars | Real users don't have photo URLs |
