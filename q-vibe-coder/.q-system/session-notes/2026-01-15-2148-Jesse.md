## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Read banner color from localStorage | Consistent color across components without prop drilling |
| Use img=3 for Alex Sanders | Clearly visually distinct from Albert Einstein's img=68 |
| Crop hero image to 55% height | Remove duplicate text from screenshot |
| Update all Alex avatar references | Maintain consistency across demo login and activity feeds |
