# Session Notes: 2026-01-21-1534-Brian

**Summary:** Built complete enrollment flow with 3 options (EnrollOptionsModal), purchase modal with payment form, and Find Student Teacher functionality. Created HTML mockups matching exact app formats, then rewrote FindTeacherView.js with Summary Detail and Profile Page views. Fixed multiple navigation and render order bugs.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 3-option enrollment modal | Gives users flexibility - purchase now, find teacher, or pick date |
| Pre-filled card data in PurchaseModal | Makes demo testing easier without typing |
| Reset enrollment states on menu change | Prevents stale modals from showing when navigating |
| Match exact community profile format | User explicitly requested consistency with existing UI |
| Two view modes in FindTeacherView | Summary for browsing, Profile for details |
| Render order fix (showFindTeacher before isPurchased) | React early returns prevent later code from running |
