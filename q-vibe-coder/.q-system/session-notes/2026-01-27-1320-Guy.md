## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Slideout as default nav | User preference for cleaner navigation |
| Creative community names | Distinguishes community (group) from creator (person) |
| 👥 emoji badge for communities | Universal "group" symbol, immediately recognizable |
| Letter abbreviations for courses | Distinct from community badges, informative |
| Option 5: Blue + Green | User selected from 8 mockup options; calm, good distinction |
| Single green for all courses | Simplifies visual hierarchy vs category-specific colors |
