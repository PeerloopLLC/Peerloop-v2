## Accomplishments So Far

### 1. Clickable Teacher Summary Cards
- Made teacher summary cards in FindTeacherView clickable
- Added `onClick` handler to card wrapper that calls `onViewTeacherProfile`
- Added hover effects (translateY, box-shadow) for visual feedback
- Added `cursor: pointer` styling
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to "Book Session +" button so it doesn't trigger card click

### 2. Removed Sessions/Reviews Section from Summary Cards
- Removed the tabs section (Sessions/Reviews tabs)
- Removed the sessions list with thumbnails
- Removed the "Go to Profile →" link (no longer needed since card itself is clickable)
- Removed unused `activeTab` state variable
- Cards now end cleanly after the credentials list

### 3. Profile Navigation from FindTeacherView
- Added `onViewTeacherProfile` prop to FindTeacherView component
- Updated MainContent.js (both usages of FindTeacherView) to pass the callback
- Callback implementation:
  - Sets `showFindTeacher = false`
  - Sets `viewingCourseFromCommunity = null`
  - Sets `enrollingCourse = null`
  - Calls `onMenuChange('Profile')`
  - Calls `handleViewMemberProfile(user)` with teacher's `_originalUser` data

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `src/components/FindTeacherView.js`
  - Added `onViewTeacherProfile` prop to component signature
  - Made card wrapper clickable with onClick handler
  - Added hover effects (transform, box-shadow)
  - Added stopPropagation to Book Session button
  - Removed activeTab state (unused after removing tabs)
  - Removed entire sessions/reviews tabs section (~90 lines)
  - Removed "Go to Profile →" link

- `src/components/MainContent.js`
  - Updated both FindTeacherView usages to include `onViewTeacherProfile` callback
  - Callback navigates to Profile component with selected teacher's user data

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Click entire card for profile | More intuitive - whole card is clickable target |
| Remove sessions/reviews from summary | Cleaner cards, user requested removal |
| Use `_originalUser` for profile data | Contains full user data structure needed by Profile component |
| Change activeMenu to 'Profile' | Required because render order: Discover check comes before viewingMemberProfile check |
| stopPropagation on Book button | Prevents card click when clicking Book Session |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Testing the profile navigation flow
**Issue encountered:** Initial implementation navigated to Discover page instead of Profile because:
- `activeMenu === 'Discover'` check (line 1336) comes before `viewingMemberProfile` check (line 2119)
- Fixed by adding `onMenuChange('Profile')` to the callback

**Testing needed:** Verify clicking teacher card now shows their Profile

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test the complete flow: Discover → Course → Enroll → Find Teacher → Click card → See Profile
- [ ] Verify Back button from profile works correctly
- [ ] Ensure "Book Session +" button still works (doesn't trigger profile navigation)

## Technical Notes

- Build compiles successfully after all changes
- Dev server running on localhost:3000/Peerloop-v2
- Real profiles (Patricia Parker, Brandon Blake, etc.) from users.js are working
- Profile component accepts `viewingUser` prop to display another user's profile
