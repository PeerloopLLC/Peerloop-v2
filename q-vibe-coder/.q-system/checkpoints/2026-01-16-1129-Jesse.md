## Accomplishments So Far

### From Previous Checkpoint (1116):
- Cleaned up all tmpclaude temp files from project directories
- Deleted duplicate peerloop-v2 folder
- Deleted backup files (.backup) and nul artifacts
- Added subtitle "Choose A Community Feed" under My Feeds header in slideout panel
- Fixed community selector click behavior - now always navigates to selected community
- Made The Commons header collapsible when scrolling using smooth CSS transitions
- Applied same smooth CSS transitions to creator profile headers for collapse effect
- Changed scroll collapse threshold from 100px to 1px for immediate response

### Since Last Checkpoint:
- Attempted to fix double scrollbar issue on right side of main content
- Changed `.main-content` overflow from `auto` to `hidden` in MainContent.css
- Changed `.center-column` overflow to `hidden` then back to `auto`
- Added `html, body { overflow: hidden; height: 100vh; }` to index.css
- Changed `.three-column-layout` from `min-height: 100vh` to `height: 100%`
- Changed `.center-column` from `height: 100vh` to `height: 100%`
- Tested scrolling in Discover and My Courses - scrolling works
- Double scrollbar issue STILL PERSISTS despite multiple fixes

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.css` - Changed overflow and height settings for `.main-content`, `.three-column-layout`, and `.center-column`
- `my-project/code/src/index.css` - Added `html, body { overflow: hidden; height: 100vh; }`

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Set html/body to overflow: hidden | Prevent browser-level scrollbar, only allow component-level scrolling |
| Use height: 100% instead of 100vh for inner elements | Let containers inherit height from parent rather than independently sizing to viewport |
| Keep .center-column as the scrollable container | Single point of scrolling for main content area |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Debugging double scrollbar issue - two scrollbars appear on the right side of the content area
**Issue:** Despite multiple CSS changes, double scrollbar persists. Can see in screenshots that there are two scrollbar tracks on the right edge of the content.
**Partially complete:** The scrolling itself works - Discover and My Courses can scroll. The problem is visual - two scrollbars instead of one.

## CSS State Summary

Current CSS settings:
- `html, body`: `overflow: hidden; height: 100vh`
- `.main-content`: `overflow: hidden; height: 100vh`
- `.three-column-layout`: `height: 100%` (changed from `min-height: 100vh`)
- `.center-column`: `overflow-y: auto; height: 100%` (changed from `height: 100vh`)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Investigate why double scrollbar still appears despite all containers having controlled overflow
- [ ] Check if there's a nested element creating the second scrollbar
- [ ] Consider using browser DevTools inspection approach
- [ ] May need to check DiscoverView and MyCoursesView for inline styles creating scroll
- [ ] Test all user accounts for correct behavior
- [ ] Verify dark mode compatibility for new styles
