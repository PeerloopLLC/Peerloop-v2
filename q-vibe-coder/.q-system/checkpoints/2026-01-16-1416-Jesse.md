## Accomplishments So Far

- Researched BigBlueButton hosting providers for video conferencing integration
- Found BiggerBlueButton.com with free forever plan ($0, API access, 50 users)
- Updated BBB credentials in bigbluebutton.js from test server to BiggerBlueButton
- Added new `joinCourseSession()` function for persistent course-based meeting rooms
- Wired "Join Session" button in CourseDetailView.js to BigBlueButton
- Implemented CORS workaround (open create URL first, then navigate to join)
- Tested integration multiple times in browser

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/utils/bigbluebutton.js` - Updated credentials, added joinCourseSession function
- `my-project/code/src/components/CourseDetailView.js` - Import BBB utility, added handleJoinSession handler, wired Join Session button

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use BiggerBlueButton.com free plan | Free forever, API access, no credit card needed |
| Persistent room per course (not per session) | User preference - one room that resets each session |
| Everyone joins as moderator | User preference - all participants can present |
| Use course ID for meeting ID | Creates persistent `peerloop-course-{id}` room names |
| CORS workaround via tab navigation | BBB API requires server-side calls, workaround opens create URL in tab first |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Debugging BBB integration - getting "invalidMeetingIdentifier" error
**Issue:** The create meeting API call may not be completing before join redirect
**Root cause investigation:** Checking if credentials/URL format is correct

**User provided API Mate link to verify credentials:**
- Server: `https://biggerbluebutton.com/bigbluebutton/peerloop/`
- Secret: `yi97Xfc4CusF0VvNRuwL7WopWakRCwXRebpD2aficA8`

**Current config in bigbluebutton.js:**
- BBB_URL: `https://biggerbluebutton.com/bigbluebutton/peerloop/api/`
- BBB_SECRET: `yi97Xfc4CusF0VvNRuwL7WopWakRCwXRebpD2aficA8`

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify BBB credentials are correct using API Mate
- [ ] Test getMeetings API call to confirm credentials work
- [ ] Fix the integration so meetings create and join successfully
- [ ] Consider if a Supabase Edge Function is needed for proper server-side API calls
