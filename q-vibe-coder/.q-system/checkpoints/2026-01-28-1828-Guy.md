## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Move tabs above Your Sessions | Better visual hierarchy - tabs control content below |
| Remove Session Files tab | Files integrated into Curriculum per module |
| Grey session circles | Less visual noise, green reserved for completed |
| Green Join button | Matches Enroll button, indicates action |
| Name comparison for isCreator | User ID format differs from instructorId |

## Current Status

**Working on:** User requested removing scrollbars from middle content area
**Interrupted:** User started /q-compact while discussing scrollbar styling

**Last user request:**
> "See how the middle window on the right has no scrollbar? then click on discover and my courses and see the scroll bar. I want all scroll bars gone. make them all like my feeds"

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Hide scrollbars across all views (Discover, My Courses, etc.)
- [ ] Match scrollbar styling to My Feeds (hidden but scrollable)
- [ ] Test across different pages

## Technical Notes

### Key Styling Applied
```css
/* Divider under tabs */
.course-detail-tabs {
  paddingBottom: 16,
  borderBottom: isDarkMode ? '1px solid #2f3336' : '1px solid #eff3f4'
}

/* Grey session circles */
background: rowState === 'completed' ? '#10b981' :
            rowState === 'locked' ? (isDarkMode ? '#2f3336' : '#e5e7eb') :
            (isDarkMode ? '#536471' : '#9ca3af')

/* Green Join button */
background: '#10b981'
```

### File Structure for Files Feature
- Files stored in `item.files` array on curriculum items
- Each file object: `{ name: string, size?: string, url?: string }`
- Creator sees "+ Add File" button via isCreator prop
