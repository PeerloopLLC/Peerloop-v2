## Accomplishments So Far

- Fixed the "header missing" bug when navigating Settings > Selector (Card) > back to The Commons
  - Root cause: The selector mode's hub view only rendered the Reddit pill + description text, but was missing the "Main Hall" / "Member Search" feed pills
  - Added Main Hall and Member Search pill buttons to the selector mode hub section
- Added the commons-banner.png classroom image to the selector card
- Repositioned the dropdown pill to be ABOVE the banner image (matching the Albert Einstein community layout)
- Final layout for selector mode (The Commons): Dropdown pill → Banner image → Description → Main Hall/Member Search pills → Feed

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` — Three changes:
  1. Lines ~2174-2242: Replaced simple description text with description + Main Hall/Member Search pill buttons for selector mode hub view
  2. Lines ~1984-2010: Added commons-banner.png image to selector card (hub mode only), restructured outer container with `overflow: 'hidden'` and removed padding from outer div
  3. Lines ~2172-2185: Split padding wrapper into two sections — one wrapping the pill selector (above banner), one wrapping the profile info + course pills (below banner)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Added Main Hall / Member Search pills to selector mode | These were only in non-selector mode, causing the "missing header" bug |
| Dropdown pill placed above banner | User requested it match Albert Einstein community layout |
| Banner image only shows for hub mode | Creator communities don't have a banner — they have profile info instead |
| Used overflow: hidden on outer container | Allows banner image to fill edge-to-edge within rounded card |
| Split into two padding wrappers | Pill needs padding, banner needs no padding (edge-to-edge), content below needs padding |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Completed — the selector card now matches the desired layout with dropdown above banner, matching other community views.

**Completed:** All three issues resolved:
1. Missing Main Hall / Member Search pills in selector mode
2. Missing banner image in selector mode
3. Dropdown positioning (now above banner, matching Albert Einstein)

## Next Steps

- [ ] User may want further visual tweaks to the selector card
- [ ] Clean up wireframe HTML files if no longer needed (public/wireframe-*.html)
- [ ] Potential: Make the banner image collapsible on scroll (like the non-selector mode)
