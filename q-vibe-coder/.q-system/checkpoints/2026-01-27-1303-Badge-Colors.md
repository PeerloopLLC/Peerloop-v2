## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Option 5: Blue + Green | User selected from 8 mockup options; calm, nature-inspired, good distinction |
| Single color for all courses | Simplifies visual language - courses are green, communities are blue |
| 👥 badge in BrowseView detail | Consistency with Discover page community cards |
