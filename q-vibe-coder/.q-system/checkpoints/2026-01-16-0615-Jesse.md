## Accomplishments This Session

### From Previous Checkpoint (0542)
- Swapped sidebar menu positions: community selector on top, "My Feeds" label below
- Community selector shows: selected community name + total count + arrow pointing out
- "My Feeds" is now a static label with no arrow
- Removed the grey vertical line from the left side of the feeds-group in sidebar
- Connected banner color from Profile settings to the "View All Courses" page header in BrowseView.js

### New Since Last Checkpoint
1. **Course listing format update in BrowseView.js**
   - Changed "View All Courses" course cards to match Discovery page format
   - Removed thumbnail images, replaced with gradient backgrounds
   - Added course descriptions instead of stats row
   - Put price inside Enroll button ("Enroll $349" instead of separate price)
   - Removed "View course →" link

2. **Slideout panel: The Commons fixed at top**
   - Modified FeedsSlideoutPanel.js to keep The Commons section fixed
   - My Communities section now scrolls independently below The Commons
   - Added CSS styles for `.slideout-commons-fixed` with border separator

3. **Commons button label change**
   - Changed button "1" to "Ask AI" in The Commons feed pills
   - Buttons now show: Main Hall, Ask AI, 2, 3

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Match Discovery course format | User wanted consistency between Discovery and View All Courses |
| The Commons stays fixed in slideout | User requested Commons always visible while communities scroll |
| Button "1" → "Ask AI" | User requested this label change |
