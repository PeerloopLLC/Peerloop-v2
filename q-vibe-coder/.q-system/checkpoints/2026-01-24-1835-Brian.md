## Key Decisions

| Video full width | User requested larger video |
| What You'll Learn in sidebar | User approved wireframe with this layout |
| Topics + Curriculum full width | User explicitly requested both to span screen left to right |
| Expandable module accordion | Matches wireframe-course-detail-v2.html design |
| Remove sidebar cards | Clean up UI - Instructor, Course Details, What's Included, Price CTA removed |

## Current Status

**Working on:** User requested to remove the "Curriculum" tab since curriculum is now on Overview
**Next task:** Remove Curriculum tab from tab bar, delete the old curriculum tab content block

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Remove "Curriculum" tab button from tab bar
- [ ] Delete `{activeTab === 'curriculum' && (...)}` block
- [ ] Verify tabs show: Overview | Course Feed | Reviews
- [ ] User reviews and provides feedback

---

## Prompt for Next Task (after compact)

**Remove the "Curriculum" tab from the CourseDetailView component.**

In `my-project/code/src/components/CourseDetailView.js`:

1. Find the tab bar section that renders the 4 tabs: `Overview`, `Course Feed`, `Curriculum`, `Reviews`
2. Remove the `Curriculum` button/tab from the tab bar
3. Delete the entire `{activeTab === 'curriculum' && (...)}` conditional block that renders the old curriculum view

The tabs should go from:
- Overview | Course Feed | Curriculum | Reviews

To:
- Overview | Course Feed | Reviews
