## Accomplishments So Far

### 1. Side-by-Side Calendar Layout (Option 1)
- Implemented new side-by-side calendar layout for booking sessions
- Layout: Calendar on left, available times on right
- Only appears when user: Find Student Teacher → clicks "Book Session +" on specific teacher
- Shows teacher name and avatar in header
- Green confirmation summary at bottom when time selected
- Added `renderSideBySideLayout()` function to EnrollmentFlow.js

### 2. Real User Profiles Integration
- **FindTeacherView.js**: Updated to import `communityUsers` from `users.js`
- **EnrollmentFlow.js**: Same approach - pulls from real user database
- Replaced fake profiles (Marcus Chen, Jessica Torres, Alex Sanders, Sarah Kim) with real community users
- Real profiles now showing:
  - Patricia Parker (ProductPioneer42)
  - Brandon Blake (BackendBoss99)
  - Carlos Mendez (CloudMaster_Pro)
  - Nathan Nguyen (NeuralNetNinja)
  - Amanda Stevens (AIStudent_2024)
  - Olivia Foster (OpenCV_Fan)
  - Nicholas Lopez (NLPMastermind)
  - Tanya Morrison (TextMiner_Pro)
- Avatar handling: Uses colored initials since real users don't have photo URLs
- Stats display real data: students taught, ratings, courses completed

## Files Changed

  - Added `generateAvailability()` function for simulated availability
  - Replaced hardcoded mock `studentTeachers` array with useMemo that pulls from real database
  - Added `renderSideBySideLayout()` function for pre-selected teacher flow
  - Updated avatar rendering to use `avatarColor` for initials fallback

- `src/components/FindTeacherView.js`
  - Added `communityUsers` import from users.js
  - Added `generateAvailability()` function

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Filter by `userType === 'student_teacher'` | Only show users certified to teach |
| Generate availability from user ID hash | Consistent but varied availability per teacher |
| Use `avatarColor` for initials display | Real users don't have photo URLs |
| Limit to 8 teachers max | Better UX, avoid overwhelming lists |
| Transform user data to expected component format | Maintain backwards compatibility with existing UI |

## Current Status

**Working on:** User wanted to show me a flow and describe what they see
**Interrupted by:** /q-compact command

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review the flow user wants to show
- [ ] Continue UI testing/refinement as needed

---

## Technical Notes

- Build compiles successfully after all changes
- Tested with Playwright - real profiles showing in enrollment flow
- Dev server running on localhost:3000/Peerloop-v2
- Real profiles visible: Patricia Parker, Brandon Blake, Carlos Mendez, etc.
