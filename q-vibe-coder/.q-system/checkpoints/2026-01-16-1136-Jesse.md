## Accomplishments So Far

### From Previous Checkpoints (1116, 1129):
- Cleaned up all tmpclaude temp files from project directories
- Deleted duplicate peerloop-v2 folder
- Deleted backup files (.backup) and nul artifacts
- Added subtitle "Choose A Community Feed" under My Feeds header in slideout panel
- Fixed community selector click behavior - now always navigates to selected community
- Made The Commons header collapsible when scrolling using smooth CSS transitions
- Applied same smooth CSS transitions to creator profile headers for collapse effect
- Changed scroll collapse threshold from 100px to 1px for immediate response
- Multiple attempts to fix double scrollbar issue (overflow changes to MainContent.css and index.css)

### Since Last Checkpoint (1129):
- **FIXED the double scrollbar issue** by adding `overflow-y: hidden` to `.app` in App.css
- Root cause identified: CSS quirk where `overflow-x: auto` implicitly sets `overflow-y: auto`
- User diagnostic helped: scrolling over sidebar was moving the right scrollbar, indicating `.app` container was scrollable

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/App.css` - Added `overflow-y: hidden` to `.app` container (line 751)

**Previously modified this session:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.css` - Changed overflow and height settings
- `my-project/code/src/index.css` - Added `html, body { overflow: hidden; height: 100vh; }`
- `my-project/code/src/components/FeedsSlideoutPanel.js` - Added subtitle under My Feeds header
- `my-project/code/src/components/FeedsSlideoutPanel.css` - Added subtitle styling
- `my-project/code/src/components/Sidebar.js` - Fixed community selector navigation
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` - Smooth collapsible headers

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Add overflow-y: hidden to .app | CSS quirk: when overflow-x is auto, overflow-y defaults to auto too. Explicitly setting overflow-y: hidden prevents app-level vertical scrolling |
| Keep .center-column as only scrollable element | Single scroll container prevents double scrollbar |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Verifying double scrollbar fix
**Last action:** Added `overflow-y: hidden` to `.app` in App.css
**Awaiting:** User confirmation that scrollbar behavior is fixed (scrolling over sidebar should NOT move the right scrollbar)

## CSS Scroll Configuration Summary

Current scroll-related CSS:
- `html, body`: `overflow: hidden; height: 100vh`
- `#root`: `height: 100vh`
- `.app`: `overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: hidden; height: 100vh`
- `.main-content`: `overflow: hidden; height: 100vh`
- `.three-column-layout`: `height: 100%`
- `.center-column`: `overflow-y: auto; height: 100%` (THE ONLY SCROLLABLE ELEMENT)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Confirm double scrollbar fix works (user testing)
- [ ] Test all user accounts for correct behavior
- [ ] Verify dark mode compatibility
- [ ] Any additional UI refinements as needed
