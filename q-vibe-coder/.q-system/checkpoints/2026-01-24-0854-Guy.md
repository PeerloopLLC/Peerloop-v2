## Accomplishments So Far

- Changed community selector dropdown from pill shape (borderRadius: 24) to square shape (borderRadius: 0)
- Made selector bar fill full card width (removed wrapper horizontal padding, set to 0)
- Removed outer card margins (changed from '8px 16px 0 16px' to '0')
- Removed outer card border, borderRadius, and boxShadow for cleaner edges
- Added `width: '100%'` to outer card container
- Removed selector bar's own border (changed to borderBottom only with 1px separator line)
- Removed selector bar boxShadow
- Updated hover effects (background only, no border color changes)
- Made banner image slightly wider with `calc(100% + 2px)` and `marginLeft: '-1px'` to address subpixel rendering differences
- Added `display: 'block'` to banner image

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` - Selector bar and card container restyling

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| borderRadius: 0 on selector | User wanted square, not pill |
| No horizontal padding on selector wrapper | Match card width |
| Card margin: 0, border: none, borderRadius: 0 | Eliminate visual framing differences |
| Selector border: none, borderBottom only | Remove width discrepancy from selector border |
| Banner width: calc(100% + 2px) | Address subpixel rendering making banner look narrower |

## Current Status / Issue in Progress

**Problem:** User says the Commons banner image still looks narrower than the dropdown selector, despite DOM measurements confirming they are exactly the same width (790px, same left/right positions). Subpixel rendering or DPI differences between Playwright and user's browser may be causing the visual discrepancy.

**Also noted:** User asked "where did all the feeds go for the communities" right before requesting compact - this needs investigation. The feeds were visible in Playwright screenshots, so may be a different issue in user's browser.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Investigate "feeds missing for communities" issue user reported
- [ ] Continue resolving banner width visual match
- [ ] Consider reverting the calc(100% + 2px) hack and using a different approach (e.g., background-image instead of img tag)
- [ ] Test the selector changes on creator communities (not just The Commons)
- [ ] Commit changes once user approves
