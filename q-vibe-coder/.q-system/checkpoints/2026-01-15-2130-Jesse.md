## Accomplishments So Far

- Connected Profile banner color selection to My Feeds and Discovery page headers
- Added `bannerColor` state to Community.js and DiscoverView.js that reads from localStorage
- Updated selector mode and pills mode profile cards in Community.js to use user's selected banner color
- Updated DiscoverView.js search results to use user's selected banner color
- Redesigned The Commons header with hero banner image layout
- Copied user's exact screenshot image to `public/commons-banner.png`
- Cropped the banner image to remove text portion (878x318 → 878x174)
- Changed Alex Sanders' avatar from `img=68` to `img=12` to differentiate from Albert Einstein

- `my-project/code/src/components/DiscoverView.js` - Added banner color reading, updated search result backgrounds

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Read banner color from localStorage in each component | Allows consistent color across Profile, My Feeds, and Discovery without prop drilling |
| Use `getUserBannerGradient()` helper function | Centralized gradient generation for cleaner code |
| Crop screenshot image to 55% height | Remove text portion from original screenshot since text is rendered separately |
| Change Alex avatar to img=12 | Differentiate from Albert Einstein who uses img=68 |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Verified Alex's avatar change - need to confirm it displays differently from Albert Einstein
**Partially complete:** Avatar verification in progress

## Next Steps

- [ ] User testing and feedback on banner color feature
- [ ] Any additional styling refinements if requested
