## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove Discover header card | User requested removal of "Discover Communities and Courses" header |
| Pill-style "See all courses" button | User wanted consistency with filter pills above search |
| Post button below Profile | X.com-inspired layout, prominent action button |
| More (...) opens Settings | Secondary nav items moved to popup menu |
| Remove Settings from nav | Moved to More popup to reduce nav clutter |

## Current Status

**Working on:** User wants to restructure: move Post button BELOW "More", and make "More" open a popup menu (like X.com) instead of navigating directly to Settings. The popup should contain Settings, Bookmarks, Dark Mode, Help, Log out.

**Partially complete:** The Post button and More item exist but in wrong order (Post is above More). More currently navigates directly to Settings instead of opening a popup.

**User approved wireframe:**
- Nav items (My Feeds through Profile)
- ... More (click opens popup with Settings, Bookmarks, Dark Mode, Help, Log out)
- Post button (blue, below More)
- My Feeds section

## Next Steps

- [ ] Swap order: move Post button below More in Sidebar.js
- [ ] Implement popup menu for More (appears above/near the More button)
- [ ] Add popup items: Settings, Bookmarks, Dark Mode, Help, Log out
- [ ] Style the popup menu (similar to X.com's clean dropdown)
- [ ] Handle click-outside to close popup
- [ ] Verify on screen with screenshot
