## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/BrowseView.js`
  - Added `useState` import
  - Added `FaFolder, FaPlay, FaFileAlt, FaLink` icon imports
  - Added `activeProfileTab` and `selectedContentItem` state
  - Added `generalContent` sample data structure
  - Replaced "COURSES BY" header with tabbed menu (Courses | Content)
  - Added General Content tab with left-nav/right-content layout
  - Updated tab styling to clean horizontal buttons (matching course detail page)

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use same tab style as course detail page | User requested clean horizontal button style like "Overview, Course Feed, etc." |
| Rename "GENERAL CONTENT" to "Content" | Shorter, cleaner label matching the simple style |
| Use left-nav/right-content layout for Content tab | User referenced Skool classroom layout as the desired pattern |
| Three content types: video, file, link | Covers common free content creators share (tips, resources, external links) |
| Default to first content item when switching to Content tab | Prevents empty right panel on tab click |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Completed the tabbed menu feature for community profiles
**Partially complete:** N/A - feature is fully functional
**Last action:** Updated tab styling from boxed with icons to clean horizontal text buttons

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Tab Menu Structure
```jsx
<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: 0, borderBottom: '1px solid ...' }}>
  <button>Courses</button>
  <button>Content</button>
</div>
```

### General Content Data Structure
```javascript
generalContent = {
  sections: [
    {
      id: 'getting-started',
      title: 'Getting Started',
      items: [
        { id, type: 'video', title, description, duration, url },
        { id, type: 'file', title, description, fileType, url },
        { id, type: 'link', title, description, url }
      ]
    },
    // ... more sections
  ]
}
```

### Content Display by Type
- **Video**: Play icon, video placeholder, duration display
- **File**: File icon, file type label, Download button
- **Link**: Link icon, URL display, Open Link button

- [ ] Add creator admin interface to manage their general content
- [ ] Consider adding more content types (audio, embed, etc.)
- [ ] Test dark mode compatibility for new components
- [ ] User testing and feedback on the new layout
