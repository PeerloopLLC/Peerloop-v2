## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Search bar borderRadius: 0 | User wanted square, matching community selector |
| Pills above header card | User requested pills between search and card |
| Scroll arrows on pills | User wanted navigation arrows on each side |
| Right sidebar with 2 courses | Matching Figma design reference |
| Sidebar hidden < 1100px | Responsive - only show when there's room |
| Center column flex: 0 0 auto | Prevent center column from shrinking when sidebar present |
| Banner width: '100%' clean | Removed calc hack that wasn't working reliably |

## Current Status / Issue in Progress

**Problem:** The right sidebar is being implemented as a flex sibling of center-column. The center-column has `flex: '0 0 auto', width: '100%', maxWidth: 800` to prevent shrinking. However, there's currently a JSX nesting issue being resolved - an extra closing div was removed but need to verify the page compiles and renders correctly with the sidebar visible.

**The sidebar structure:**
- Positioned as a sibling div after center-column, inside three-column-layout
- Width: 280px, flexShrink: 0
- Contains sticky inner div with "Suggested Courses" header + 2 course cards
- CSS class `discover-right-sidebar` with media query to hide on narrow screens

**Compilation status:** Last edit removed an extra `</div>` - needs verification that JSX is balanced and sidebar renders correctly.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Verify the Discover page compiles and renders correctly after div fix
- [ ] Confirm the right sidebar is visible on wide screens
- [ ] Confirm center column maintains its proper width
- [ ] Test that sidebar hides on screens < 1100px
- [ ] User's earlier issue: "where did all the feeds go for communities" - still uninvestigated
- [ ] Commit changes once user approves
