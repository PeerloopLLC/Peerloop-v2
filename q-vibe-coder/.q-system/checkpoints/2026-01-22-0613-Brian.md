## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Place Member Search in The Commons | User wanted it to replace "Ask AI" pill, makes sense as community hub |
| Use communityUsers as data source | Contains all member types with usernames for profile lookup |
| All members navigate to same Profile page | User explicitly requested - same format Sarah sees for her profile |
| Removed onViewCreatorProfile for Member Search | No longer needed - all members use onViewUserProfile with username |
| Show member type badges (Creator, Student Teacher, Student) | Visual differentiation while keeping same profile destination |
