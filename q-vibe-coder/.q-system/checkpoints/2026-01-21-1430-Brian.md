## Key Decisions

| Reset enrollment states on menu change | Prevents stale modals from showing |
| 4 student teachers in fake data | Enough variety for demo |
| Match exact community profile format | User explicitly requested this |

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Create HTML mockup matching Summary detail format exactly
- [ ] Update FindTeacherView.js to use the new format
- [ ] Test complete flow

## Resume Prompt

After /q-compact, paste this:

**Continue creating student teacher profile HTML mockups:**

User wants the student teacher profile to match EXACTLY these two formats from the app:

1. **Profile Page** (Profile menu → Guy Rymberg):
   - Banner, avatar overlapping, Edit button
   - Name, @handle, [Creator] badge, bio
   - Location · Website · Joined date
   - Following/Followers counts
   - Stats row: Courses Taken | Students Helped | Rating
   - Tabs: Posts | Courses Taken | Courses Taught

2. **Summary Detail** (My Courses → click Guy's summary):
   - Back button
   - Avatar + "Guy Rymberg Community" + COMMUNITY badge + Go to Community + Joined button
   - Tagline
   - Stats: ⭐ 4.9 · 👥 527 students · 📚 1 courses
   - Full bio
   - ✓ Credentials list
   - Tabs: Courses | Content

**Screenshots saved at:**
- `.playwright-mcp/guy-profile-page.png`
- `.playwright-mcp/guy-summary-detail.png`

**Task:** Create TWO HTML wireframes that replicate these formats exactly, adapted for student teachers instead of creators/communities.
