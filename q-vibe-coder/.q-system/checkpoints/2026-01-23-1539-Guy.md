## Accomplishments So Far

- Committed and pushed settings.local.json update to GitHub (77927a0)
- Published app to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`
- Redesigned Discover header to match Community header card pattern:
  - Search bar above the card (stays sticky on scroll)
  - Gradient banner card with text overlay: "Join a community and get access to that community feed. Enroll in a course and get access to that course feed."
  - Filter pills moved inside the gradient card (not in separate white section below)
  - Banner + text collapse on scroll, search bar + pills remain visible
  - Pills styled with semi-transparent white borders on gradient background

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/DiscoverView.js` - Complete header card redesign (search above card, gradient banner with text overlay, pills inside gradient)
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Settings update (committed + pushed)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Search bar above card, not inside | Matches Community pattern (dropdown above card) |
| Text overlaid on gradient banner | User preference - text within banner, not below |
| Pills inside gradient card | Matches Community "Main Hall" pill placement inside header card |
| Semi-transparent white pill styling | Readable on purple gradient, consistent feel |
| Purple gradient (6366f1 → 8b5cf6 → a78bfa) | Matches app accent colors |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Discover header card redesign - complete and visible in browser
**Partially complete:** N/A - current task is done

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test scroll collapse behavior for the new Discover header
- [ ] Verify collapsed state shows pills on gradient correctly
- [ ] Consider if banner needs an image instead of solid gradient
- [ ] Commit the DiscoverView.js changes
- [ ] Deploy updated version to GitHub Pages
