## Accomplishments Since Last Checkpoint

### BBB Integration Committed
- Committed all BBB integration work to git (hash: 781f821)
- 7 files changed, 713 insertions
- Includes: Edge Function, bigbluebutton.js utility, CourseDetailView modal, checkpoints

### BBB Feature Investigation
- User asked about video option - investigated BiggerBlueButton free tier
- Free tier: 1GB storage, 50 person capacity, single concurrent session
- Webcam button IS present in BBB action bar, but may require:
  - Joining audio first
  - Browser camera permissions
  - Or may be disabled on free tier (unclear from docs)

### Pre-loading Content Discussion
- User asked how to add notes and pre-load course material
- BBB supports:
  - **Shared Notes** - Collaborative Etherpad built-in
  - **Pre-uploaded presentations** - PDF/slides can be loaded via API
  - API uses XML body with `<modules><module name="presentation"><document url="..."/></module></modules>`

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use Monaco API for deployment | Browser typing had issues, Monaco setValue() worked |
| Encode `!` as `%21` | BBB checksum requires this encoding |
| Keep BBB credentials hardcoded | Testing phase - can move to env vars later |

---

## Current Status

**Completed:**
- BBB integration fully working (meeting creation, join, embedded iframe)
- All code committed to git

**Pending user decisions:**
- Video option investigation (may need paid tier or different provider)
- Pre-loading course material (need to know where PDFs will be stored)

---

## Technical Details

**BBB API for Pre-loading Presentations:**
```javascript
// POST body for create API
const presentationXml = `
<modules>
  <module name="presentation">
    <document url="https://example.com/slides.pdf" />
  </module>
</modules>
`;
```

**BBB Credentials:**
- URL: `https://biggerbluebutton.com/bigbluebutton/peerloop/api/`
- Secret: `yi97Xfc4CusF0VvNRuwL7WopWakRCwXRebpD2aficA8`

## Next Steps

- [ ] Decide on video solution (upgrade BBB or use alternative)
- [ ] Implement pre-loaded presentations if user wants
- [ ] Store course PDFs in Supabase Storage or external URL
- [ ] Update Edge Function to accept presentation URL parameter
