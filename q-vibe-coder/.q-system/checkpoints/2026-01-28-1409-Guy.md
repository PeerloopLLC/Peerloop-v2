## Accomplishments So Far

- Removed "Go to Community →" text from course detail page community header
- Removed click/link functionality from community header (no longer navigates to community)
- Removed duplicate "← Back" button from CourseDetailView.js (kept only parent's "← Back to Discover")
- Verified all changes visually with browser testing

---

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/CourseDetailView.js`
  - Removed "Go to Community →" span (lines 684-692)
  - Removed onClick handler and hover effects from community mini-header card
  - Removed duplicate back button that was rendering alongside parent's back button

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Remove "Go to Community" link text | User request - cleaner UI |
| Remove community header click behavior | User request - header should just display community name, not be a link |
| Remove CourseDetailView back button | Duplicate - parent component (BrowseView) already renders "← Back to Discover" |
