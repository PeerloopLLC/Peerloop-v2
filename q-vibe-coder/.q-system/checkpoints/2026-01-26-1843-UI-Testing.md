## What Was Done This Session

### 1. Enrollment Modal Redesign Testing (Complete)
Verified the simplified enrollment modal works correctly:
- No purple gradient header
- Clean text-only design
- Header: "How do you want to enroll in [Course Title]?"
- 3 options with titles and descriptions

### 2. All 3 Enrollment Options Tested (Guy's Courses)

| Option | Flow | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| **1. Get Instant Access** | Enroll → Payment → Done | ✅ Working |
| **2. Choose Your Teacher** | Enroll → Browse teachers → Pick teacher → Pick date/time → Payment | ✅ Working |
| **3. Choose Your Schedule** | Enroll → Pick date first → See available teachers → Payment | ✅ Working |

**Tested with Sarah on Guy's courses:**
- AI Prompting Mastery → Option 1 (instant access)
- AI Tools Overview → Option 2 (choose teacher - Patricia Parker, Jan 27 10AM)
- Intro to Claude Code → Option 3 (choose schedule - Alex Sanders, Jan 28 11AM)

### 3. Alex Certification Flow Test (Complete)
- Logged in as Alex
- Enrolled in AI Prompting Mastery via "Get Instant Access"
- Navigated to course detail (enrolled view)
- Found Module 5: Certification Prep section
- Shows: "Final assessment, portfolio review, and becoming a certified Student-Teacher"

### 4. Bug Found: "Intro to n8n" Enrollment
**Issue:** Clicking "Choose Your Teacher" option closes the modal instead of showing teacher list
- Works for: AI Prompting Mastery, AI Tools Overview, Intro to Claude Code
- Fails for: Intro to n8n
- Likely cause: `onSelectFindTeacher` callback not properly connected for this course

## Current Status

**Working on:** Bug fix for "Intro to n8n" enrollment - Choose Your Teacher option closes modal

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Investigate why `onSelectFindTeacher` doesn't work for n8n course
- [ ] Fix the bug in CourseDetailView.js or EnrollOptionsModal.js
- [ ] Test fix

---

## Prompt to Continue

```
Fix bug: "Intro to n8n" course enrollment - "Choose Your Teacher" option closes modal instead of showing teacher list.

Context:
- Other Guy courses work fine (AI Prompting Mastery, AI Tools Overview, Intro to Claude Code)
- Only "Intro to n8n" fails
- Likely the onSelectFindTeacher callback isn't connected properly for this course
- Check CourseDetailView.js and how enrollment options are passed
```
