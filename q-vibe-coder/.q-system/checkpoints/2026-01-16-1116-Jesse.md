## Accomplishments So Far

- Cleaned up all tmpclaude temp files from project directories
- Deleted duplicate peerloop-v2 folder (was already moved to separate project)
- Deleted backup files (.backup) and nul artifacts
- Added subtitle "Choose A Community Feed" under My Feeds header in slideout panel
- Fixed community selector click behavior - now always navigates to selected community (like My Feeds)
- Made The Commons header collapsible when scrolling using smooth CSS transitions
- Applied same smooth CSS transitions to creator profile headers for collapse effect
- Changed scroll collapse threshold from 100px to 1px for immediate response
- Attempted to fix double scrollbar issue by changing overflow settings

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/FeedsSlideoutPanel.js` - Added subtitle under My Feeds header
- `my-project/code/src/components/FeedsSlideoutPanel.css` - Added subtitle styling and dark mode support
- `my-project/code/src/components/Sidebar.js` - Fixed community selector to always navigate + toggle slideout
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` - Smooth collapsible headers for Commons and creator profiles, reduced scroll threshold to 1px
- `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.css` - Changed .main-content and .center-column overflow from auto to hidden

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use CSS max-height transitions for collapse | Smoother animation than conditional rendering which was jerky |
| Set scroll threshold to 1px | User wanted immediate collapse on any scroll |
| Changed overflow to hidden on parent containers | Attempting to fix double scrollbar issue |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Debugging double scrollbar issue on right side of main content
**Partially complete:** Double scrollbar fix - changed MainContent.css but issue persists

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Fix double scrollbar issue - need to find the other container with overflow-y: auto
- [ ] Test all user accounts for correct behavior
- [ ] Verify dark mode compatibility for new styles
- [ ] Any additional UI refinements as needed
