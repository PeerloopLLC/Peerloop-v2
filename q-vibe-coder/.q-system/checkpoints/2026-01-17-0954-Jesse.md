## Accomplishments So Far

### 1. Previous Session Work (from checkpoint 0845)
- Fixed community reset bug on login - clears localStorage and dispatches event
- Committed as `6c2564d`

### 2. Course Detail View Button Styling
- Changed "Continue Learning" button text to "Join Session"
- Updated button styling to match Discover menu buttons:
  - Pill shape (`borderRadius: 20`)
  - White background with border (`border: 1px solid #cfd9de`)
  - Black text (`color: #0f1419`)
  - Hover effect
- Applied same styling to "Go to Community" button
- Applied same styling to sidebar "Join Session" button (Next Session Alert section)

### 3. Made Join Session Buttons Functional
- Added `onClick={handleJoinSession}` to top Join Session button
- Added `disabled={isJoiningSession}` state handling
- Both Join Session buttons now launch BigBlueButton video sessions
- Shows "Joining..." state when clicked

### 4. BigBlueButton Integration Research/Discussion
- Discussed wrapper approach for adding PeerLoop elements around BBB
- Created wireframe options: Top Toolbar, Side Panel, Minimal Floating Bar
- Discussed BBB's built-in features (chat, notes, etc.)
- Explored `helpLink` parameter for external help links
- **Key insight:** helpLink opens new tab, can't open frame inside BBB
- **Solution:** PeerLoop wrapper with sliding help panel

### 5. Helper On-Call System Design
- Designed concept for assigning helpers to sessions
- Helpers (Student-Teachers) can be on-call during live sessions
- Students use sliding panel to ask questions
- Helpers see questions in their dashboard
- Revenue opportunity for Student-Teachers

### 6. Current Task: Build Demo Slide-Out Panel
- User requested simple slide-out demo within BBB modal
- Slides from right side, top to bottom
- Simple placeholder message: "This is where you add functionality"
- No additional features yet, just demo the flow

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/CourseDetailView.js`
  - Lines 336-364: Join Session button - added onClick, styling, disabled state
  - Lines 366-400: Go to Community button - updated to pill style
  - Lines 1254-1280: Sidebar Join Session button - updated to pill style

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Pill-shaped buttons (`borderRadius: 20`) | Match Discover menu button styling |
| White background with border | Consistent with Enroll/Join buttons elsewhere |
| Both Join Session buttons call `handleJoinSession` | Consistent behavior regardless of where clicked |
| Wrapper approach for BBB | Can't inject into BBB, but can wrap it |
| Sliding panel for help chat | Simpler than trying to bridge BBB chat |
| Helper on-call system | Fits PeerLoop's Student-Teacher earning model |
