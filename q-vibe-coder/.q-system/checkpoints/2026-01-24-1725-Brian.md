## Accomplishments So Far

- Created course detail page wireframe v2 (post-enrollment view) with all 4 tabs working: Overview+Curriculum, Resources, Feed, Reviews
- Implemented session-level scheduling with Scheduled/Not Scheduled states
- Built expandable module accordion with Learning Objectives, Topics, Hands-On Exercise content
- Created pre-enrollment wireframe (dark mode) rendering the wireframe-course-detail-page.md spec as interactive HTML
- Created pre-enrollment wireframe (light mode) with white background version using the spec's color palette
- Verified all wireframes in Playwright browser with screenshots

## Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-course-detail-v2.html` - Post-enrollment course detail (dark mode, 4 tabs, session scheduling, module accordions)
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-course-detail-pre-enroll.html` - Pre-enrollment page (dark mode, hero, curriculum+enrollment, Learn&Earn, creator, teachers)
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-course-detail-light.html` - Pre-enrollment page (light/white mode version)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Session-level scheduling (not module) | User chose this in plan phase |
| Expandable accordion for modules | Shows titles+durations collapsed, detail on click |
| Creator (Guy) in header, Student-Teacher (Alex) inline in session | Distinct roles per plan |
| 4 tabs: Overview+Curriculum, Resources, Feed, Reviews | User-approved tab structure |
| Dark mode as primary, light mode as alternate | App uses dark mode; user requested white version for comparison |
| Pre-enrollment = two-column with sticky enrollment card | Follows wireframe-course-detail-page.md spec |
| Light mode uses #00ba7c green, #536471 gray, #e2e8f0 borders | From wireframe spec color palette |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Completed all three wireframe HTML files. User requested light mode version which is done.
**Partially complete:** Nothing in progress - all wireframes complete and verified.

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] User reviews wireframes visually and provides feedback
- [ ] Iterate on design based on user's taste preferences
- [ ] Once wireframe approved, implement in React (CourseDetailView.js)
- [ ] Decide which version to implement (pre-enrollment vs post-enrollment, or both as different states)
- [ ] Dark vs light mode decision for the React component
