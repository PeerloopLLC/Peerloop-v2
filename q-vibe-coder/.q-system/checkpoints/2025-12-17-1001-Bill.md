## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Role-based toggle (Learning/Teaching) | Users think in mindset mode, not feature mode. Clearer mental model than 4 tabs |
| No "All" button | Confusing - users are usually in one mindset or the other |
| Remove calendars from main dashboard | Declutter. Calendar only needed for setting availability |
| Sub-pages via "View All" links | Keep sidebar clean. Natural discovery through dashboard sections |
| Text stats instead of boxed stats | Cleaner, less visual clutter, matches overall aesthetic |
| Prominent Availability card | Important for S-T workflow, was buried before |
| Weekly grid for availability | Easy click-to-toggle interface for setting available hours |
| Students/Earnings/Availability as sub-pages of Dashboard | Logical hierarchy, teaching stuff lives under Dashboard |
