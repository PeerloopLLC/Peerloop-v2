## Accomplishments So Far

### UI Cleanup (from previous checkpoint)
- Removed "Go to Community →" text from course detail page community header
- Removed click/link functionality from community header
- Removed duplicate "← Back" button from CourseDetailView.js

### Mockup Creation (this session)
- Created HTML mockups for combining Curriculum with Session Files
- Explored 4 different options for integrating files into curriculum:
  - Option A: Files integrated at bottom of each session
  - Option B: Clear Modules/Files sections per session
  - Option C: Two-column layout (modules left, files right)
  - Option D: Unified session cards (everything together)

- Created module-level file upload/download mockups:
  - Student view: Inline download links per module
  - Creator view: Three-dot menu with Upload option
  - Creator view: Inline "+ Add File" button

- Refined mockups to match current site styling:
  - Light theme (#f7f9fa background, white cards)
  - Blue accent (#1d9bf0)
  - Pill tabs matching site style
  - Grey file download buttons (changed from pink)
  - Added "Your Sessions" card with Join/Reschedule buttons

- `scratchpad/mockup-two-sessions.html` - Two-session course examples
- `scratchpad/mockup-module-files.html` - Module-level file options with icons
- `scratchpad/mockup-no-icons.html` - Clean version without icons
- `scratchpad/mockup-site-style.html` - Final mockup matching current site style

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Combine Session Files tab with Curriculum | Files shown inline per module, no separate tab needed |
| Module-level file uploads | Each module can have its own files, more granular than session-level |
| Grey file buttons | Matches site's neutral color scheme better than pink |
| Keep "Your Sessions" card | Shows scheduled sessions with Join/Reschedule buttons above tabs |
| Pill tabs: Curriculum, Course Feed, Reviews | Removed "Session Files" since files are now in Curriculum |

## Current Status

**Working on:** HTML mockups for new course detail page layout
**Completed:** Final mockup with site-matching styles

**Mockup features:**
- Community header (light blue gradient)
- Course title + instructor
- Stats line
- "Your Sessions" card with Join/Reschedule buttons
- Pill tabs (Curriculum, Course Feed, Reviews)
- Course Curriculum with:
  - Session headers (collapsible)
  - Module rows with grey file download links
  - "+ Add File" button for creators

## Next Steps

- [ ] User to approve mockup design direction
- [ ] Choose between three-dot menu vs inline "+ Add File" for creators
- [ ] Implement chosen design in actual React components
- [ ] Update CourseDetailView.js with new curriculum/files integration
- [ ] Add file upload functionality to modules
- [ ] Test on live site

## Technical Notes

### HTTP Server Running
- Python http.server on port 8888 serving mockup files
- Background task ID: b1e28e6

### Key Styling (for implementation)
```css
/* File download link - grey */
.file-link {
  background: #eff3f4;
  color: #536471;
