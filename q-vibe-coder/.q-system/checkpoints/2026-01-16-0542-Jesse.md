- Removed the grey vertical line from the left side of the feeds-group in sidebar
- Connected banner color from Profile settings to the "View All Courses" page header in BrowseView.js

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Community name on top with count + arrow | User requested this layout - shows active community prominently |
| "My Feeds" as static label below | Simplifies the UI - no arrow needed for this label |
| Arrow points outward (→) not dropdown | User specified outward-pointing arrow to indicate panel opens to the side |
| Remove grey vertical line | User requested removal of the decorative line |
| Apply banner gradient to BrowseView header | Consistency - same color should appear across all community headers |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Banner color consistency across the app
**Completed:** Sidebar menu swap, banner color on View All Courses page

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test banner color changes across different color selections
- [ ] Verify dark mode compatibility for new sidebar styles
- [ ] Consider any remaining UI refinements user may want
