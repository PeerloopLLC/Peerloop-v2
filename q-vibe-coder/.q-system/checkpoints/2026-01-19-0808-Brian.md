## Accomplishments So Far

### S-T Dashboard UI Updates (PRD alignment)
- Updated 3 stat cards: Active Students, Total Taught, Total Earned
- Added star rating display (★★★★★) next to welcome message
- Added Pending Balance section showing pending earnings
- Added Quick Links section with 3 buttons (Set Availability, My Students, Earnings History)

### S-T Stats Data Layer
- Built complete data layer for tracking S-T statistics
- Stats stored in localStorage with `stTeacherStats_${userId}` key
- Created helper functions: addActiveStudent, completeStSession, certifyStudent
- Connected data layer to dashboard - stats now show real values (0/0/$0 initially)

### PRD Review
- Read and analyzed 2026-01-19-jesse-design-prd.md
- Created side-by-side comparison of current vs PRD screens
- Identified 2 new S-T screens needed: Certify Student, Earnings History

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use localStorage with userId scoping | Matches existing app pattern (purchasedCourses, scheduledSessions) |
| Stats start at 0, not mock data | User requested functional data layer, not fake numbers |
| $315 per certification | PRD spec: S-T gets 70% of $450 = $315 |
| Star rating shows 0 when no ratings | Honest representation of new S-T status |

---

## Current Status

**Completed:** S-T Dashboard tab UI + data layer
**Stats verified:** Showing 0/0/$0 as expected

## Next Steps

- [ ] Build My Students tab (with student cards, Certify button)
- [ ] Build Certify Student modal (module checklist, certification notes)
- [ ] Build Earnings History tab
- [ ] Update Set Availability tab to match PRD calendar grid
- [ ] Wire up actual triggers (when student enrolls, session completes, certification issued)
