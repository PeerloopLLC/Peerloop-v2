## Accomplishments So Far

- Read implementation plan for Discover Tab UX Improvements
- Analyzed current DiscoverView.js structure (~1739 lines)
- Created Option A wireframe mockup: Circle vs Square badges (wireframe-discover-circles.html)
- Created Option B wireframe mockup: Card Style Differentiation (wireframe-discover-card-styles.html)
- Updated Option A mockup to make community name a clickable blue link with hover underline
- Showed user both wireframe options via Playwright screenshots
- Started implementing Option A changes in DiscoverView.js (user requested undo)
- Reverted DiscoverView.js changes per user request
- Restored Option B wireframe after user requested undo of full-detail version
- Started React app and navigated to Discover tab for user to compare with wireframes

## Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-discover-circles.html` - Option A mockup with circle badges for communities, square for courses
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-discover-card-styles.html` - Option B mockup with full-width banner headers for communities

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-discover-circles.html` - Added blue clickable community name styling

**Reverted:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/DiscoverView.js` - Reverted early implementation attempt per user request

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Circle badges for communities | Universal UX pattern - circles = people/social, squares = content/products |
| Square badges for courses | Maintains current course badge style, associated with structured content |
| Blue clickable community name | Matches course title and creator link styling for consistency |
| Shadow lift + border highlight hover | Industry standard for clickability indication |
| User prefers Option B | Full-width banner headers give stronger visual hierarchy |
| Wait for user approval before code changes | User explicitly requested to undo code changes until approved |

---

## Current Status

**Working on:** Awaiting user decision on which wireframe option to implement
**Partially complete:**
- Wireframe mockups created (both options)
- User has seen both options in Playwright screenshots
- App is running and showing Discover tab for comparison

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] User to review wireframes and decide on final design
- [ ] User to specify if they want Option B with full course details included
- [ ] Implement chosen design in DiscoverView.js:
  - Change community badge to circle (border-radius: 50%)
  - Make community name blue clickable link with hover underline
  - Add improved hover effects (shadow lift + border highlight)
  - If Option B: Restructure layout with banner headers and nested courses
- [ ] Apply consistency changes to other components:
  - Sidebar.js
  - MyCoursesView.js
  - BrowseView.js
  - FeedsSlideoutPanel.js
- [ ] Test in browser (light and dark modes)
- [ ] Verify hover effects work correctly
