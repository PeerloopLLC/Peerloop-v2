## Accomplishments So Far

- Attempted to add comments/endorsements section to Sarah Miller's profile, then reverted per user request
- Opened the app in browser (Playwright/Chromium) via dev server on localhost:3000
- Identified the community selector card at top of feed as the element to improve
- Provided 5 text wireframe options (A-E) to make the selector more obviously a dropdown
- Created HTML wireframe of Option B (full-width select bar) at `public/wireframe-community-selector-option-b.html`
- Provided 7 additional design pattern ideas inspired by Discord, Slack, Reddit, Notion, YouTube, iOS, Gmail
- Created comprehensive HTML wireframe of all 7 options at `public/wireframe-selector-options.html`
- Implemented Option B first (border + chevron, removing "Switch" pill button)
- Then implemented the Reddit-style pill selector per user preference (rounded pill, search icon, smaller avatar, name only, chevron)
- Verified the dropdown still works correctly with the new styling
- Identified a bug: when navigating Settings > Selector Card > back to Commons, the outer container/header styling may be missing (user reported "header is missing")

## Files Changed

**Created:**
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-community-selector-option-b.html` — Option B wireframe
- `my-project/code/public/wireframe-selector-options.html` — All 7 selector options wireframe

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/Community.js` — Changed the community selector bar from "Switch" pill button style to Reddit-style rounded pill with search icon, smaller avatar, name-only text, and chevron arrow
- `my-project/code/src/data/users.js` — Briefly added then removed comments array from Sarah Miller's profile (net: no change)
- `my-project/code/src/components/UserProfile.js` — Briefly added then removed comments section (net: no change)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Reddit-style pill selector | User chose this from 7 options — looks like a search input which everyone recognizes as interactive |
| Removed "Switch" pill button | Replaced with just a chevron; the whole bar is now the click target |
| Added FaSearch icon | Reinforces the "this is an input" pattern |
| Smaller avatar (28px vs 36px) | Fits better in the pill shape |
| Removed subtitle text | Cleaner, less cluttered pill — just shows community name |
| borderRadius: 24px | Creates the pill/capsule shape |

## Current Status

**Working on:** User reported that after going to Settings > selecting "Selector (Card)" nav mode > navigating back to The Commons, the header appears to be missing. Need to investigate this bug.

**Partially complete:** The Reddit-style pill selector is implemented and working for the default "Selector (Card)" mode, but there may be a rendering issue when switching back from other views.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Investigate why the header/container disappears after Settings > Selector Card > back to Commons
- [ ] Fix the rendering bug if confirmed
- [ ] Consider whether the outer container (with border, shadow, padding) around the selector needs adjusting for the new pill style
- [ ] Clean up wireframe HTML files if user doesn't need them anymore
