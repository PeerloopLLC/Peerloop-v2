## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Letter/abbreviation badges for courses | User chose this option from mockups; distinct from 👥 community badges |
| Category-specific gradients for courses | Different colors help identify course categories at a glance |
| 32x32 badges in slideout | User preferred smaller size matching The Commons badge |
| 12px margin between badge and text | Proper visual spacing in slideout panel |

## Next Steps
