## Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Fixed Scrolling Bug in Course Detail View
- User reported scrolling stopped working inside courses
- Investigated using Playwright browser automation
- **Root cause:** `.main-content` had `overflow: hidden` blocking all vertical scrolling
- Course content was 1738px but only 765px visible, with no way to scroll
- **Fix:** Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden`
- Committed: 2bc7201

### 2. Changed Menu Text
- Changed left menu slideout trigger text from "11 communities" to "Choose A Community Feed"
- Updated `Sidebar.js` line 449
- Committed: e2b4364

### 3. Deployed Both Changes
- Pushed to GitHub
- Deployed to GitHub Pages via `npm run deploy`
- Live at: https://peerloopllc.github.io/Peerloop-v2/

## Files Changed

**Modified:**
- `my-project/code/src/components/MainContent.css`
  - Line 5: Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow-y: auto; overflow-x: hidden`

- `my-project/code/src/components/Sidebar.js`
  - Line 449: Changed community count to static "Choose A Community Feed" text

---

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use `overflow-y: auto` instead of `overflow: auto` | Allows vertical scroll while preventing unwanted horizontal scroll |
| Static text instead of dynamic count | User wanted clearer instruction for users |
