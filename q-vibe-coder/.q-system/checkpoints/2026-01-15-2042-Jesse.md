## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use creator index in groupedByCreator array for color selection | Ensures consistent color per creator based on their position in user's followed list |
| Apply same 4 pastel colors as Discovery page | User requested matching styling between Discovery and My Feeds |
| Keep dark mode gradient unchanged (#1a2332 to #1e293b) | Maintains consistency with existing dark mode styling |

## Color Scheme Implemented

The 4 alternating pastel colors (matching Discovery page):
- Index 0: Soft blue (#e8f4f8 → #f0f7fa)
- Index 1: Warm cream (#faf5eb → #f8f3e8)
- Index 2: Soft green (#f0fdf4 → #ecfdf5)
- Index 3: Soft red/pink (#fef3f2 → #fef2f2)
