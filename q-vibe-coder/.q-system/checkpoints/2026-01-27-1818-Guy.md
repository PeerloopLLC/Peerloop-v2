## Accomplishments So Far

- Created Option A wireframe: Circle badges for communities (`wireframe-discover-circles.html`)
- Created Option B wireframe: Banner headers for communities (`wireframe-discover-card-styles.html`)
- User reviewed both options and chose **Option B** (banner headers)
- Updated Option B wireframe with full course details (description, benefits, stats)
- Condensed Option B wireframe spacing while keeping all data and original text sizes
- Measured badge sizes on deployed app (peerloopllc.github.io): 56px course badges, 48px community badges
- Read DiscoverView.js (1739 lines) to understand current structure
- Identified key sections to modify for Option B implementation

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Option B chosen | User prefers full-width banner headers for communities |
| Circle badges for communities | Visual distinction - circles = social/groups |
| Square badges for courses | Visual distinction - squares = content/products |
| Keep all data, reduce spacing only | User requested condensed view without removing information |
| Update ALL files for consistency | User confirmed: DiscoverView, Sidebar, MyCoursesView, BrowseView, FeedsSlideoutPanel |

## Current Status

**Working on:** Implementing Option B wireframe in DiscoverView.js
**Ready to implement:** Changes identified, wireframe approved

## Implementation Plan

### DiscoverView.js Changes (lines ~1199-1573):

**Community Header (lines ~1199-1385):**
1. Change badge from square (borderRadius: 10) to circle (borderRadius: 50%)
2. Make full-width gradient banner with white text
3. Put name, @handle, followers, course count in header
4. Move "Following" button into banner
5. Below banner: creator row + full bio

**Courses List (lines ~1388-1573):**
1. Wrap in container with gray background (#fafbfc)
2. Add "Courses in this community" label
3. Remove marginLeft: 60 indent
4. Keep course card styling (56px green badge, blue title, benefits, stats)

**Hover effects:**
- Course cards: translateY(-1px), green border, shadow
- Community header: brightness(1.05)
