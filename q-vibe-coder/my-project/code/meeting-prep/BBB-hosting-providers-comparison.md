**Research Date:** 2025-11-26  
**Purpose:** Evaluate BBB hosting for PeerLoop MVP  
**Decision Criteria:** Per-session pricing, API access, Analytics, US support, Integration ease

---

## ✅ STATUS UPDATE (2025-12-03)

**RIADVICE Meeting Success:** Completed video call with CEO Ghazi Triki on 2025-12-02. Brian + Fraser attended. Clear pricing received!

**Key Win:** Fraser was able to discuss **deep technical issues** directly with Ghazi - technical credibility established.

**Current Position:**
1. ✅ **RIADVICE** - Quote received: **$150/mo hosting + $500 integration** ⭐ BEST QUOTE + TECHNICALLY VETTED
2. ⏳ Blindside Networks - awaiting response
3. ⏳ BigBlueButton Host - awaiting response
4. ⏳ JETROOM - awaiting response (99.99% uptime guarantee)
5. ❌ HigherEdLab - DISQUALIFIED (no-show)

**Strong Position:** Have 1 solid, technically-vetted quote, 3 pending responses. RIADVICE = $2,300/year total (within our $2.4K-3.6K budget estimate).

**Timeline:** Dec 6 deadline = 3 days to decide.

**Recommendation:** RIADVICE is current front-runner with Fraser's technical approval. Wait for Blindside/BBB Host/JETROOM responses for comparison, but RIADVICE is a solid choice.

**IMPORTANT:** Launch date is **April 2026**, not April 2025 (corrected in email template).

- [ ] Recording storage limits during trial?

**Real User Testimonial:**
> **Chris Hermann** (Maths Tutor, UK - Test-prep & Tutoring)
> 
> "I looked at all the offerings... about 7 providers and software settling on BigBlueButton about 18 months before Covid hit... **Nothing but nothing comes close to BBB for educational use**, and every time I have to use Zoom I hate it - it is awful."
> 
> **On Self-Hosting BBB:**
> "BigBlueButton is REALLY not a good idea for self install if you are not strongly technically inclined. I spent 20 years in the IT industry... and it was never an easy thing to install. Worse still is that upgrading can be a pain too."
> 
> **On HigherEdLab:**
> "About 2 years ago I started using **HigherEdLab.com** to provide the BigBlueButton service. **I can't recommend them enough.** I literally had to make one change to my working BigBlueButton installation to link my existing frontend to their servers - **it just worked**."
> 
> "They now manage any upgrade processes and as part of that agreement they give me access to their Turn server. For me it is the perfect compromise."
> 
> **Post-COVID Reality:**
> "Not one of my tutees has even requested a return to 'in person' sessions... I have picked up tutees from referrals from existing and past tutees from family members or friends scattered about. One is ~500 mile round trip away and the other a 2 hour flight (Greece)... **I am not going back to pre covid working thanks to BigBlueButton.**"
> 
> "I am sure once you get used to BigBlueButton there is no way you would ever go back to Zoom."

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Evaluated 7+ providers, chose BBB (validates your research)
- ✅ Education-focused user case = same as PeerLoop
- ✅ Self-hosting BBB = "pain" even for 20-year IT veteran (Fraser should use hosted!)
- ✅ HigherEdLab = "just worked" with one config change
- ✅ Students prefer online now (post-COVID market validation)
- ✅ Referral business works online (supports your flywheel model)

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Quick Screen (Before Fraser's Deep Dive)
**You do this ASAP:**

1. **Email template to send all providers:**

```
Subject: PeerLoop - BBB Hosting Inquiry for EdTech Startup

Hi [Provider],

We're building an EdTech platform (PeerLoop) launching April 2026 
with ~60-80 students and need BBB hosting for 1-on-1 tutoring sessions.

Key requirements:
- ~60 sessions/week (1 hour each)
- API integration with our platform
- Session analytics/reporting
- Automatic recording + MP4 download
- US-based support preferred

Questions:
1. Pricing model: Per-session, per-user, or flat rate?
2. API access for programmatic session creation?
3. What analytics data is available?
4. SSH/server access level?
5. Trial period available?
6. Estimated monthly cost for our volume?

Timeline: Need to decide by Dec 6, 2025
Budget: Part of $75K total development budget

Best regards,
Brian LeBlanc
PeerLoop
brian@peerloop.com (use your actual email)
```

2. **Send to these 4 first (best fit for MVP):**
   - BigBlueButton Club (free trial!)
   - BBB On Demand (per-session model?)
   - JETROOM (API emphasis + uptime guarantee)
   - BigBlueButton.org (official support)

### Phase 2: Fraser Technical Evaluation
**After you get responses:**

Fraser reviews:
- API documentation
- Integration complexity (1-2 weeks realistic?)
- Analytics depth
- Setup process

### Phase 3: Cost Comparison
**Decision matrix:**

| Provider | Setup | Monthly | Per-Session? | Analytics | API Quality | Total (4mo) |
|----------|-------|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| TBD      | TBD   | TBD     | TBD          | TBD       | TBD         | TBD         |

---

## US-Based Provider Note

From transcript: "I can find in the United States, so I can talk English"

**Reality Check:**
- BBB is international (Canadian origin)
- Most providers are global (EU, Tunisia, India)
- US-based options limited
- **Blindside Networks (Canada)** = closest to US, English-speaking, original team

**Recommendation:**
- Prioritize **English support hours** over physical location
- Ask about **US edge servers** for performance
- Time zone overlap for support calls

---

## Your 4pm Meeting Prep

If meeting is with one of these providers, ask:

1. **Show me your analytics dashboard** (screenshare)
2. **Walk me through API integration** (docs review)
3. **What's included in your API?**
   - Create session
   - Join URLs
   - End session
   - Get recording
   - Session metadata
4. **Fraser's concern:** Can he SSH in, or is it fully managed black box?
5. **Cost scenario:** 60 sessions/week, 1 hour each, for 4 months = ?

---

## Next Steps

- [ ] Send inquiry email to 4 providers today
- [ ] Document 4pm meeting notes
- [ ] Fraser reviews top 2-3 API docs
- [ ] Cost comparison spreadsheet
- [ ] Decision by Dec 6 (10 days)
